                                            <p>As part of his individual project at the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, Dr. Nathaniel Leibowitz (a cohort 20 fellow) conducted a survey in which he examined trends among the non-Haredi Jewish public on the question of ‚Äúintegrative education,‚Äù that is, the merging of the state and state-religious school systems. The survey, which appears in its entirety on the site of the Israel Democracy Institute,&nbsp;included 500 respondents from the non-Haredi public (religious, traditional religious, traditional non-religious, and secular). The findings show that while a majority of the public (64%) supports the existing separation between the various educational streams, when survey participants were asked where they would register their children if they had three options available to them ‚Äî a state school, a state-religious school, and an integrated school ‚Äî&nbsp;the largest share (33%) responded that they would register their children at an integrated school.</p>
<p>The survey indicates that support for integrating the streams is strongest among the population that defines itself as traditional: more than 40% of this group responded that they would register their child at an integrated school, underscoring the importance of this group in preventing polarization between the various Jewish sectors in Israel.</p>
<p>Dr. Leibowitz‚Äôs project is one of 19 to be presented by MSEL cohort 20 fellows over a two-day project presentations conference at MLI on Monday and Tuesday 10-11 June 2013. The full program of the conference (in Hebrew) can be found <a href="../attachments/projectpresentationscohort20.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>‚Äã.</p>
