<p>The 21 fellows of Cohort 26 presented the fruits of their learning journey to an audience comprising their colleagues, their individual tutors and faculty members who supported them over the course of their studies, and experts from the field of education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The learning experience of the Mandel School includes three main components: honing professional identity by means of in-depth study, clarifying values and worldviews, and formulating a vision; studying content related to the fellows‚Äô professional field of action, including research-based, theoretical, and practice-oriented content; and formulating a practical proposal for an intervention in the field of education.<br><br></p>

<p>‚ÄúNot all the seeds that were sown here over the last two years have already produced shoots,‚Äù said <strong>Danny Bar Giora</strong>, the director of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership. ‚ÄúI have no doubt that what you take with you from the program will have an impact wherever you go and whatever positions you hold. I recommend that you look back in five years' time, and try to answer the question of how much you have succeeded in realizing the dreams you formulated here at the Mandel School.‚Äù</p>
