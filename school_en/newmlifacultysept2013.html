<p>
   <strong>Bambi Sheleg</strong> is a journalist, publicist and editor, who champions a Jewish and Israeli public discourse, both deep and broad in scope, that focuses on social justice and identity. To further these goals, in 1999 she established the "Eretz Acheret" non-profit (literally, A Different Land), which publishes the "Eretz Acheret" magazine. The magazine examines and analyzes social, cultural and economic processes in Israeli society and the Jewish world. In recognition of her efforts to foster relations between Jews of differing world-views Bambi was awarded the 1998 Liebhaber Prize for the Promotion of Religious Pluralism and Tolerance in Israel, awarded by the Masorti Movement of Israel; the 2011 B’nai B’rith World Center Award for Journalism Recognizing Excellence in Diaspora Reportage; and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's 2012 Simon Ethel Flegg Award, for promoting mutual acceptance between the different factions in the contemporary Jewish world. Bambi is a columnist for Yediot Aharonot, and a board member of Yad Vashem.</p>
