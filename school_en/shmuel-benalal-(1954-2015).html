                <div class="article-content">
                                            <p style="text-align:justify;">​Shmuel Benalal&nbsp;moved to Israel from Venezuela and was one of the earliest residents 
of Tzur Hadassa, near Jerusalem. An expert in educational consulting, 
training and management, he was CEO of the Telos Group, a consulting 
firm specializing in educational and social international development. 
Among other projects, Shmuel participated in development initiatives of 
the World Bank, the European Union, UNICEF and UNESCO, and consulted 
for Jewish communities in several countries, as well as governments in 
Eastern Europe, Latin America, and South-East Asia.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br>Shmuel was a 
graduate of cohort 2 of the Mandel Jerusalem Fellows. After completing 
his studies, he engaged in developing Jewish education abroad, and was 
principal of the Tarbut day school in Mexico. He wrote curricula and 
served as an academic advisor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He 
also authored handbooks on educational planning, school development, the
 role of parent committees in education and the integration of children
 with disabilities into educational frameworks. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br>At the Mandel 
Foundation, Shmuel directed from 1997 to 1999 the Intensive Development 
Programs (IDP) for senior professionals from abroad, which ran alongside
 the Mandel Jerusalem Fellows. In recent years he was a member of the 
tutoring development team headed by Dr. Daniel Marom, and led workshops
 for Mandel fellows. This year, in addition to developing the workshop 
for first-year fellows, Shmuel became one of the tutors for the project 
workshop of the Mandel Programs for Leadership Development in the Haredi
 Community. Together with the director of the Mandel School for 
Educational Leadership, Danny Bar Giora, he also took part in a 
consulting project for Ministry of Education staff.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br>Over the 
years, Shmuel served as personal tutor to many Mandel fellows. He was 
loved and valued by those he tutored and by his colleagues, and was 
always generous in sharing his wisdom, experience and good-naturedness.
 One of the fellows he was tutoring this year mourned him with lines 
from Bialik:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right:0px;text-align:justify;"><p dir="ltr"><em>“There
 was a man – and look, he is no more.<br>He died before his time.<br>The 
music of his life suddenly stopped.<br>A pity!&nbsp; There was another song in 
him.<br>Now it is lost forever.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Shmuel saw his educational work 
as a Jewish and Zionist undertaking. He was a man of culture, both 
Jewish and universal. He was a synagogue cantor and was active in a 
choir. He also volunteered in a number of different settings, including 
consulting for the Hapoel Jerusalem youth basketball team, on which his 
son, Netanel, played.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><br>Shmuel was 60 when he was struck down by terror. He leaves 
behind his wife, Flori, and his children, Asher, Avi and Netanel. We 
mourn his passing with great sorrow and send our deepest condolences to
 his family. May his memory be blessed.</p>
