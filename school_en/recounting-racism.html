<p>"I'm the rare product of almost every Jewish school system in Israel: public, public-religious and Haredi - Beit Yaakov.<br> At the public-religious school I was described as 'the traditional girl from&nbsp;Katamonim where they aren't really religious'.<br> At Beit Yaakov I was nicknamed the 'Sephardic&nbsp;Ba'alat-Tshuva&nbsp;9th grader.'<br> At the school in Or Akiva where I taught I was considered the Moroccan who Ashkenized."</p>

<p>"New apartment, new neighborhood, new city. The move from Petah Tikva sparked hopes and expectations for a new, better future...<br> But the silence and disregard seemed increasingly suspicious.<br> The neighbor said: 'You're a nice Haredi, but that's how it always goes. First comes a nice Haredi and then come a whole lot of them and they aren't so nice. Really I have nothing against you except that you're a Haredi'."</p>

<p> Rinat Porat: "To spare them from 'Jerusalemite heterogeneousness'". "When my children reached junior high school age I guided them towards very particular schools in Jerusalem...<br> I am motivated by a desire to spare them from 'Jerusalemite heterogeneousness'.<br> Is that racism? Is that elitism?"</p>
