                                            <div class="mcln-paragraph" style="text-align:justify;"><div aria-labelledby="ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_RichHtmlField1_label" style="display:inline;"><p>​Is it possible to improve the quality of Israel’s early childhood 
education frameworks, and if so, how? And what would the Ministry of 
Education have to do to be prepared for a possible transfer of 
responsibility for early childhood frameworks from the Ministry of the 
Economy? At the request of the Ministry of Education, the fellows of the
 Mandel School for Educational Leadership’s 23rd cohort explored these 
questions in this year’s group exercise. At the end of the exercise, the
 fellows presented a document titled “Early Childhood Education Finds 
Room to Grow” at an event held at the school at the beginning of 
February.</p><p>The cohort 23 fellows examined three central aspects of
 early childhood education: the state’s responsibility and role 
regarding preschool children; early childhood needs and the quality of 
the public services currently provided; and organizational and 
professional aspects of the current system and the expected transition. 
To complete the picture, a brief review was conducted of the legal and 
budgetary aspects of the issue.</p><p>As part of this work, the 
fellows conducted a comparison of Israel’s early childhood daycare 
centers to other OECD countries. “Early childhood education (from birth to three years) in Israel has for years been the responsibility of the 
Ministry of the Economy, based on the idea that daycare centers were a 
means of removing barriers to women’s involvement in the labor market… 
The possible transfer of responsibility for early childhood education to
 the Ministry of Education provides a good opportunity for a 
re-evaluation of the objectives that guide policy in this area,” they 
wrote in the report.</p><p>The main claim made by the document is that, given the large 
socioeconomic gaps in Israel and the critical importance of early 
childhood for long-term individual development, there needs to be real 
investment in providing equal opportunities. The report therefore 
recommends prioritizing the improvement of the quality of early 
childhood daycare centers and educational frameworks, and selectively 
promoting access to these institutions among vulnerable populations, 
using socioeconomic criteria.​​​</p><p><strong>Moshe Vigdor</strong>, the 
director-general of the Mandel Foundation–Israel, opened the evening 
with congratulatory remarks to the cohort 23 fellows and to the school’s
 faculty, and also conveyed the best wishes of the chairman of the 
Foundation, Mr. Morton Mandel, and of its president, Prof. Jehuda 
Reinharz.</p><p>“Your decision to examine the question of early childhood frameworks 
through the lens of one of our society’s biggest problems - social 
inequality - is a values-based decision, rooted in a world view that sees 
the state and the public education system as having full responsibility 
for reducing socioeconomic gaps and creating a more just society,” said<strong> Danny Bar Giora</strong>,
 director of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership. “You then 
succeeded in translating this world view into practical recommendations…
 This connection between vision and practice is the entire ‘Mandelian’ 
approach in a nutshell,” he said.<br></p></div></div>
<div class="mcln-paragraph" style="text-align:justify;"><div aria-labelledby="ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_RichHtmlField2_label" style="display:inline;"><div><strong>​Udi Prawer</strong>,
 head of the Policy Planning Division at the Prime Minister’s Office, 
spoke about the document’s main recommendation: “The strongest support 
for the idea of starting to deal with daycare centers is the 
increasingly prevalent understanding that early childhood is extremely 
important. Perhaps in the past it was seen in terms of, ‘We’ll take care
 of any problems [caused] later on,’ and it now seems that that is 
wrong.”</div><div><strong>Ariel Levy</strong>, head of the Ministry of 
Education’s Pedagogic Administration, praised the document and said that
 in his opinion, too, the correct starting point for dealing with 
daycare centers is the wellbeing of the child. He raised other issues 
that need discussing: Should the Free Education Law be applied to these 
ages too? And what should be done about the existing situation in which 
parents who aren’t working are not entitled to subsidies for daycare?</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Dr. Esther Adi-Japha</strong>,
 head of the early childhood track at the Bar-Ilan University School of 
Education and head of the school’s Child Learning and Development 
Laboratory, spoke about the training needed to care for infants. “There 
needs to be state support for training early childhood caregivers,” she 
said. “The training that exists today focuses on ages five and up. There
 is no organized training for ages three to four, or for under-threes. 
The state needs to invest in this, and there are very few frameworks 
active in this area.</div><div><br></div><div>“Every time the education system expands, or
 special programs are introduced, the main beneficiaries are the 
stronger strata of society, because they are the ones best placed to 
exploit the system,” said <strong>Prof. Noah Lewin-Epstein</strong>, 
professor of sociology and previously dean of the faculty of social 
sciences at Tel Aviv University, who researches inequality. “If we want 
to make any kind of change, there’s no doubt we have to look at it in 
depth in order to try to reduce the enormous gaps in Israeli society.”</div><div><br></div><div>The
 Mandel School for Educational Leadership group exercise, held annually,
 is an opportunity for the school and its fellows to contribute to 
thinking about solutions to key problems facing the Israeli education 
system. In terms of fellows’ learning, the exercise offers an 
opportunity to act on the founding assumptions of the school, according 
to which meaningful change requires walking the bridge that joins 
theorists and practitioners.</div></div></div>
