                                            <p style="text-align:justify;">​Over the course of the 2015-2016 academic year, the Mandel School for 
Educational Leadership is holding a series of evening events on a range 
of contemporary political and social issues. The series is being led by 
Mandel School faculty member Dr. Yuval Evri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first event, 
held in February, examined the Paris Agreement,&nbsp;signed on December 12, 
2015 at the UN Climate Change Conference, which seeks to limit global 
warming to a rise of less than 2 degrees Celsius by 2050 and less than 
1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Lia 
Ettinger, the academic coordinator of the Heschel Center for 
Environmental Learning and Leadership and a tutor at the Mandel School,
 reviewed the state of the global environment and the central challenges
 in the field. She believes that the agreement is of historic importance
 because all the signatory countries managed to agree on realistic and 
measurable targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, among 
them the United States and China, the two main actors and most polluting
 countries in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the second half of the evening, Dr. 
Orly Ronen, head of the Urban Innovation and Sustainability Laboratory 
at Tel Aviv University’s Porter School of Environmental and Social 
Studies, explored possible environmental solutions and looked at the 
role of individuals and civil society organizations in solving climate 
problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second event in the series will be dedicated to 
International Women’s Day, and the third will deal with the proposals 
for Israel’s exploitation of its newly-discovered natural gas reserves.</p>
