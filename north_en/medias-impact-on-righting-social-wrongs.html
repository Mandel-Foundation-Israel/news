                                            <p style="text-align:justify;">On February 2, 2016, the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North hosted the second in a series of Mandel Platform events in the North on the topic of "Influence." &nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 40 graduates, fellows, and faculty members of the Center gathered to explore "The Influence of the Media on Righting Social Wrongs." </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The event featured journalist Keren Neubach, host of the IBA Reshet Bet radio show "Seder Yom" (Agenda). Following her opening address, participants engaged in a discussion of social issues, the working methods of the media in general and of "Seder Yom" in particular, the program's successes and failures in addressing social issues, and more. Neubach invited the participants to suggest topics related to social injustice for discussion on her radio program in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first event in this series was held in December 2015 and explored "The Social Influence of Humor and Satire." &nbsp;The third and last event in the series, which examined the influence of literature on moral dilemmas, was scheduled for the beginning of April.&nbsp;</p>
