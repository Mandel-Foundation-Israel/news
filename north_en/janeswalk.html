                                            <p style="text-align:justify;">​​Migdal HaEmek leadership program participants have been “learning the 
city” through walking tours, lectures, meetings with the city’s mayor, 
Eli Barda, and municipal director Shalom Zuzut, and a series called 
“Observing the View” with Yankale Steinberg (former director of the&nbsp;Mandel 
Center for Leadership in the Negev).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br>The study unit began with a 
guided walking tour (known as a “Jane’s Walk” after urban activist Jane 
Jacobs) led by three group members who presented the Migdal HaEmek of 
their childhood. In this way, participants got to know the city’s past 
through their eyes and understand their connection to the place, which 
led them to become socially involved as adults. Participants then 
explored their “sense of place” and feelings about the city, and their 
hopes for its future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br>The mayor and municipal director visited 
the program and discussed the city’s projected development. Over the 
next few years, the population is expected to grow significantly, from 
28,000 to 40,000. Migdal HaEmek’s urban planner, Hagit Naaly Yosef, 
explained the city’s social planning approach, which emphasizes 
diversity and takes into account the needs of different populations. Led
 by Yosef, the participants analyzed the city’s plans for new 
construction. Learning about Migdal HaEmek will continue to be part of 
the program, and serve as a starting point for the participants to think
 about the initiatives they wish to promote there.</p>
