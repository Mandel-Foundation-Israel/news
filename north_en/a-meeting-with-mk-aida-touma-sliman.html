                                            <p style="text-align:justify;">In early May, 2016, the graduates and fellows of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North concluded a series of encounters entitled "Identity: From Philosophy to Political Story."&nbsp; MK Aida Touma-Sliman of the Joint List (Hadash, Raam, Balad, Taal) was the guest speaker at the final session. She spoke with the participants about civic identity and the complexity of creating a common civic identity for all of Israel's citizens against the background of the conflictual reality and the ideological and political rifts in Israeli society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">MK Touma-Sliman shared her optimism with the participants. She believes that a common civic identity can be promoted in Israel, and even set forth the conditions and changes that are necessary for making it happen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The three previous sessions in the series were entitled "Identity and Multicultural Discourse," with Dr. Yuval Evri; "Ethnic Identity," with social activist and poet Shlomi Hatuka; and "Class Identity," with Dr. Ami Vatury. Staff member Dr. Asaf Turgeman facilitated the meetings, which were held as part of the continuing education programs of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North.</p>
