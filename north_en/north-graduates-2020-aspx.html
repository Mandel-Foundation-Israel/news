<p>On Monday, August 10, the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North held its second annual graduates conference. Held on the Zoom videoconferencing platform, the event was opened by the Center's outgoing director, 
   <strong>Professor David Dery</strong>, and by 
   <strong>Eviatar Baksis</strong>, a graduate of Cohort 2 of the Center's Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in the North, who represented the graduates’ steering committee.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Following the two opening addresses, the participants watched a series of short presentations from graduates and entrepreneurs who showcased their activities, focusing on the question, “How do you turn a personal dream into a social enterprise that brings together partners and impacts society?” In addition, 
   <strong>Miki Nevo</strong>, the incoming director of the Center congratulated the graduates and explained how the Mandel Foundation's relationship with its graduates in Israel is currently being addressed by the Foundation in general, and by the Center in the North in particular.</p>
<p>Next, the following presentations were made:</p>

Following the discussion, the insights from each group were shared with the full plenum using Padlet software.</p>
<p>In addition, the participants took part in three rounds of “World Coffee,” and held a discussion focusing on the question, “How do we create a participatory graduate community that will promote initiatives and activity in the North?” This was followed by a lecture on the meaning of participatory leadership by <strong>Shani Marchevsky</strong>, the founder of Hatribuna, a platform for participatory leadership in the social and private sectors.</p>
