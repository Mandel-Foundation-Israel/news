                                            <p style="text-align:justify;">​The Mandel Center for Leadership in the North hosted 120 Ministry of 
Education supervisors from the northern district for an in-service 
training day on February 12. The diverse group of educators&nbsp;- which 
included representatives&nbsp;of Jewish, Arab, Druze, and the 
state-religious school system&nbsp;- ranged from supervisors of kindergartens
 and special education to professional liaisons and Society &amp; Youth 
Administration personnel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br>The day, planned by MCN
 in cooperation with Anat Cohen, who is responsible for professional 
development in the region, was the first in a series of three seminars 
under the center’s auspices on the subject of meaningful learning. The 
opening remarks were delivered by Dr. Danielle Shani, the center’s 
director, who presented the Mandel Foundation, the northern program, and
 its underlying vision. She was followed by Dr. Ayman Agbaria, director 
of the Mandel Scholars in Education program in Jerusalem for outstanding
 doctoral students, who spoke about “Policy, Values, and Meaningful 
Learning,” introducing participants to texts by the medieval Islamic 
scholars al-Farabi and al-Ghazali. Many participants noted that this 
exposure to an unfamiliar philosophy was very meaningful for them. 
Following the lecture, workshops led by Adi Nir Sagi, Dr. Smadar Ben 
Asher and Dr. Nitza Raskin from the Mandel Center for Leadership in the
 Negev, and Ayelet Ilany and Dalit Caspin from the center in the 
North, explored the ultimate objective of learning and the educational 
process in the school setting. The day concluded with a poetry-writing 
workshop.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br>The remaining two seminars in the series will take 
place on March 20 and May 22. The program in March will deal primarily 
with learning in the urban space. For this purpose, Akko’s Old City will
 be transformed into a giant classroom, which the supervisors will 
crisscross in small teams. The day is being planned in conjunction with 
Even Derech, a company specializing in experiential learning.</p>
