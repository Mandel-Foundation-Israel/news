                                            <p>​The Nation-State Law has been a highly controversial issue that has gripped Israeli society. On October 4, 2018, a study event on this topic was held at the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North, organized and led by graduates of the Center’s programs.</p>
<p>The main part of the evening was devoted to a discussion by a panel made up of experts and figures with a particular interest in the passage of this piece of legislation.&nbsp; The panelists included former state prosecutor 
   <strong>Adv. Moshe Lador</strong>, 
   <strong>Dr. Yoaz Hendel</strong>, and 
   <strong>Brigadier General Amal Assad</strong>. The discussion of the Nation-State Law was moderated by 
   <strong>Arad Erez</strong>, a graduate of Cohort 2 of the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in the North.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the presentations by the panelists, there was an open discussion between the members of the panel and the audience, which included fellows,&nbsp; graduates, and faculty members of the Mandel Program for Social Leadership and the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in the North.<br><br></p>
