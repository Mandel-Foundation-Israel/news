                                            <p style="text-align:justify;">On March 20, graduates and fellows of Mandel Programs for Local Leadership in the North gathered to learn about human networks. The session was led by Smadar Porat, a psychologist, faculty member at the College of Education, and researcher of networks and leadership. The workshop was the third in a series offered to graduates by the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Participants in the workshop learned about basic concepts in network-oriented thinking and analyzed social phenomena from this perspective. They also explored key concepts in human networks, practiced analyzing personal and group networks, and examined applied aspects of these ideas in their own areas of practice and influence.</p>
