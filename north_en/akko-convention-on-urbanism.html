The convention was organized and supported by a number of bodies, including the Akko municipality, JDC-ELKA Institute for Leadership and Governance, the Jewish-Arab Center, the Ministry of Housing, the government planning administration, the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Jewish National Fund, and the UN Habitat III World Urban Campaign.</span></div>

Ilany described the Center’s activities over the last three years in Migdal HaEmek and Afula, and Shalaby spoke about the principles guiding its work in Arab cities in the north. This led to a lively discussion with the session participants, in particular about the question of connecting between different groups in the city and between the various bodies active in the public sphere.</span></div>

Further reflection on the convention will form part of the next session of the program in Afula. This session will host Dr. Meirav Aharon-Gutman, an urban sociologist, who also presented at the convention. Dr. Aharon-Gutman will talk about her research on Afula, and will help the fellows explore further concepts of urbanism.
