   <br>“I have no doubt that the tools you received from the dedicated professional staff at the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North will help you on the journeys on which you are now embarking,” said 
   <strong>Moshe Vigdor</strong>, director general of the Mandel Foundation–Israel. “As 
   <strong>Morton Mandel</strong> likes to say: ‘Don’t say thank you. You are doing the work, changing the world, and making it a better place, so you are actually doing my work for me.’”<br></p>
<p>The event included a performance called “Bereishit” (“Genesis”) by an ensemble of Jewish and Arab youth from Beresheet LaShalom, a nonprofit organization that promotes tolerance and coexistence through stage arts.</p>
<p>In addition to a graduation certificate, each graduate received a work of art by illustrator Aya Orbach that was based on the personal project that he or she began developing during the program and will now implement in the field. Examples of these projects include a proposal for changing the bagrut matriculation exams in a manner that will promote a more meaningful learning experience; a program to develop life skills in the Arab sector by means of experiential learning; and more.</p>
<p>“I would like to express our heartfelt thanks for the opportunity we had to meet the special people we met here," said 
   <strong>Yael Ben Moyal</strong>, who spoke during the ceremony on behalf of the new graduates. "We are thankful for the important and fascinating areas of study we were able to explore. Thank you as well to the dear members of staff, who worked to provide the most conducive and pleasant conditions for growth, and did so with great warmth and belief in us.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mandel Program for Social Leadership is a full-time, one-year study program that provides full scholarships and living stipends to participants. The Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in the North meets one day a week, with a total of 40 study days over the course of one year.<br><br></p>
