                                            <p style="text-align:justify;">​The members of the Kafr Qara local leadership group participated during 
March in a social-political photography workshop. The goal was to train 
them to use photographic language as a tool for “learning” a city from 
an educational and social perspective. The premise of the workshop was 
that photography enables individuals to connect with themselves and 
discover their artistic side and their own inner beauty. The language of
 photography offers a means of self-expression, analysis and criticism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br>The
 camera, like the eye, selects and records images, conveys the unique 
perspective of the individual and reflects his or her emotional state. 
The language of photography is familiar and accessible, enabling it to 
sidestep defenses, spark non-verbal communication and generate feedback
 that encourages creativity. Photography allows us to focus, reflect, 
develop and reframe. Globalization has made the camera available to 
most people, bringing with it the need to preserve this form of art not 
only as a tool for documenting family or historical moments but as a 
means of expressing the self.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><br>The field trips during the course 
involved a combination of movement, walking, and open space through 
which the participants were able to release energy, discover new 
viewpoints, and observe their surroundings from a different 
angle - surroundings that we constantly refer to, but don’t normally 
transform into a visual creation. At the end of the workshop, we mounted
 an exhibition of the photographs taken by the participants during the 
course.</p>
