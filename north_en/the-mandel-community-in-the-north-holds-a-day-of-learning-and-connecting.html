                                            <p style="text-align:justify;">On April 20, 2016, members of the Mandel community in the North – 70 graduates, fellows, and members of the coordinating staff – met in Acre for a day of learning and connecting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meeting began with a reception and work in small groups to enable participants from different places to get to know one another. A high point of the day was when participants learned about the work of six graduates who presented their work in two parallel sessions. Another highlight was a walking tour, of the city of Acre, conducted in groups, which enabled participants to meet six social activists who live in the city. Each group gathered in a different café to meet a local activist who spoke to them about Acre, its challenges, and the social activities that he leads or in which he is involved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The atmosphere, introductions, connections, study, and experiences were above and beyond all expectations, and the general sense was that the groundwork had been laid for establishing a Mandel community that is active and connected.</p>
