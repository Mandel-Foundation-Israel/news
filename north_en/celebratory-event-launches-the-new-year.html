                   The 2015-2016 academic year at the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North was launched on September 8 with a celebratory event attended by members of  the Mandel community in the North - fellows, graduates, tutors and staff members - from the southern and northern Triangle, the Yezreel  Valley and the Galilee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
                   The evening began with addresses from the center's director, Dr. Danielle Shani, and from representatives of the fellows and graduates: Naeemah Keadan, Yair Afik, Awny Massarwah and Dafna Hasan. The representatives related stories, read poems and spoke about the meaning of the upcoming holidays - the Jewish Rosh Hashanah and the Muslim Eid al-Adha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The keynote lecture of the event was given by Dr. Meir Buzaglo, who spoke about leadership, tradition, identity and citizenship. Buzaglo, a lecturer of philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, talked about the importance for leadership of values in general, and of compassion in particular; about the importance of leaders’ connection to their sources of identity and tradition; and about the ability of his audience - the Mandel community in the North - to propose an alternative vision for the existing reality between Jews and Arabs, and not just for the North.

    Following a festive dinner at the Tandokah restaurant in Yokne'am, there was a performance from the award-winning musician and oud player Wisam Jubran, who played a number of his own compositions in an atmosphere of togetherness and hope.
