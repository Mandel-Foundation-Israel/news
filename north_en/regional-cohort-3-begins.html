                                            <p>​Cohort 3 of the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in the North, directed by Safa Garb, began its studies at the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North on October 10, 2018. Comprised of men and women from Jewish and Arab communities in the North who were carefully selected to participate in this unique program, the new cohort will be meeting every Thursday over the course of the academic year. The program enables fellows to study together and to develop social enterprises that aim to improve Israeli society, with a focus on the north of the country.</p>
<p>The festive launch of the program included a musical introductory workshop, with the participation of the faculty of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North, in which the participants were able to express themselves in a creative manner. This was followed by an inspirational lecture from social entrepreneur 
   <strong>Yuval Roth</strong>, the founder of the nonprofit “On the Road to Recovery” and one of the winners of the “CNN Heroes” competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The day concluded with an orientation session in which expectations were set and the program’s unique learning processes were explained.<br><br></p>
