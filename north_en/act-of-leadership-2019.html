                                            <p>​At the heart of the leadership programs conducted by the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North are the clarification of the question of leadership and its implications for the lives of the fellows, as well as critical examination of accepted concepts and paradigms relating to the concept of leadership. These questions and concepts are explored in a workshop taught by the Center’s director, 
   <strong>Professor David Dery</strong>. The course introduces the fellows to the idea of the “act of leadership” – a central paradigm in the rationale of the Center’s programs.</p>
<p>At the end of the course, each fellow selects an “act of leadership” that he or she finds particularly interesting, studies it using the concepts and theories studied, and presents it to the other fellows and the faculty of the Center.<br><br></p>
