   <br>The annual graduation ceremony for graduates of all Mandel Foundation–Israel programs was held at the Jerusalem Theatre on October 17, 2021. The graduating fellows of 2021 celebrated the completion of their studies in the presence of 
   <strong>Professor Jehuda Reinharz</strong>, president of the Mandel Foundation; chairman of the board 
   <strong>Stephen Hoffman</strong> (who participated remotely); 
   <strong>Moshe Vigdor</strong>, director general of the Mandel Foundation–Israel; Ruvik Danilovich, mayor of Beer Sheva; and 
   <strong>Brigadier General Ofir Levius</strong>, IDF chief education and youth officer. 
   <strong>President Isaac Herzog</strong> honored the Foundation with his presence at the event.</p>
<p>“You are now becoming the pillars of Israeli public life in Israel, in all the spheres of influence impacting on our lives,” said 
   <strong>President Herzog</strong>. “As the president of the State of Israel, I feel much, much better knowing that it is you who are joining the spheres of influence.”<br><br><br></p>

<p>“Today marks the official recognition of the end of your intense Mandel studies. But it does not mean the end of your ties to Mandel. We will be with you as you go out and fulfill your visions to make change,” said 
   <strong>Stephen Hoffman</strong>, chairman of the board of the Mandel Foundation, who participated in the event remotely from Cleveland. “We will be with you, growing with you, and helping you continue to grow for years to come.”</p>
<p>“I have one key message for you,” said 
   <strong>Professor Jehuda Reinharz</strong>, president of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation. “We ask of you just one thing: Go and lead. Go out and make an impact. Do something…. You now have the tools and the ability to change Israeli society and the State of Israel for the better, for the benefit of all its inhabitants.”<br></p>
