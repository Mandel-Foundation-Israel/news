<p>Yael served in the Israel Defense Forces for many years in senior managerial, administrative, and command positions. In her last position, she was head of the education division of the Chief Education Officer's headquarters. In this capacity, she was responsible for defining the IDF’s educational approach; implementing the IDF’s spirit and values; and overseeing the work of the IDF culture branch, the work of the educational staffs of all IDF units, and the work of the IDF hasbara (information) units throughout the country. Yael holds a bachelor’s degree in sociology and anthropology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a master’s degree in national defense studies from the University of Haifa.</p>
<p>“We are proud that Yael Hess has been appointed director of the Institute," said <strong>Professor Jehuda Reinharz</strong>, president of the Mandel Foundation. "She comes to us with extensive experience in work with educational systems and will contribute greatly to increased momentum and renewal in the activities of the Institute.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mandel Foundation–Israel is also pleased to announce the appointment of <strong>Lieutenant Colonel Lior Peri</strong>&nbsp;as the director of the Mandel IDF Educational Leadership Program. A graduate of the 10th cohort of the program, Lior has served in a variety of positions in the Israel Defense Forces. Most recently, he was the commander of the Or Etzion military boarding school.&nbsp;Prior to that, he headed the Menashe Brigade of the Judea and Samaria Division, and was the deputy commander of the Afek Command and Staff Course at the IDF Command and Staff College. Lior holds a bachelor’s and master’s degree (cum laude) from the department of Land of Israel studies and archeology at Bar-Ilan University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We are pleased that Lior Peri&nbsp;is joining the Mandel Foundation–Israel as the director of our IDF leadership training program,” said&nbsp;<strong>Moshe Vigdor</strong>, director general of the Foundation. "The rich military experience that he acquired in his various roles in the army, both as a combat soldier and in staff positions, will assist him greatly in this important position. We will work together to ensure the success of the program and to guarantee that that it continues to meet the needs of the IDF and to live up to the expectations of the army,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of October 2018, the Mandel IDF Educational Leadership Program will report directly to the director general of the Mandel Foundation–Israel.<br></p>
