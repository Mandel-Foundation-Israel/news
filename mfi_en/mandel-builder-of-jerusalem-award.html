Mayor Barkat read the citation presented to Mr. Mandel out loud, commending him as follows:</p>
<p>"Morton Mandel is a visionary and pioneer who has worked intensively to strengthen the city of Jerusalem, the beating heart and soul of the Jewish people. Through his family's extensive investments in our city, Morton Mandel has created a powerful institutional framework to train our future leaders – identifying, cultivating and nourishing the individuals who will guide the Jewish people into the next generation and beyond. His contributions have had immeasurable impact, strengthening Jewish identity and forging transformative connections between Jews around the globe and our eternal capital.</p>
