                                            <p>“The goal of this event is to introduce you to the Foundation and its many activities, to help you realize that you are part of something much bigger that is making an impact in the State of Israel, improving things for Israeli society and all of Israel’s citizens,” said the director-general of the Mandel Foundation–Israel, 
   <strong>Moshe Vigdor</strong>, in his opening remarks.</p>
<p>Participants in the first ever Fellows' Day of the Mandel Foundation–Israel, which was held on March 18, 2021, included the fellows, faculty, and staff of all Mandel programs, as well as the Foundation's administrative staff. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the event was held in a specially designed virtual space that offered interactive options for direct communication between all participants.<br><br></p>

<p>This first Mandel Fellows’ Day brought together the fellows of all the Foundation’s leadership programs for a meaningful learning experience. The event contributed to their sense of belonging to the Foundation and to their familiarity with the Foundation’s activities and fields of interest, and gave them the opportunity to forge connections and interactions with other Mandel fellows.<br></p>
<p>In a series of parallel sessions, the directors, faculty, and fellows of the Foundation's various programs and units presented the subjects that they are exploring and challenges they are facing, in the context of their respective areas of activity and spheres of influence.</p>
<p>The Mandel School for Educational Leadership presented its policy and management&nbsp;studies, the goals of its humanities curriculum, and its workshops for fellows, to demonstrate the School's pedogical approach to teaching and learning.&nbsp;Several fellows presented their particular areas of interest: Actor and musician 
   <strong>Mohammad Kundas, </strong> a fellow in Cohort 28, spoke about culture as a compass for leadership, while filmmaker 
   <strong>Helen Yanovsky</strong>, a fellow in Cohort 29, spoke about the camera as an educational tool, focusing on documentary work by young people.<br><br></p>

<p>During the breaks between sessions, the participants were able to explore a collection of poems written by Mandel fellows. They also had the opportunity to use an online platform to get in touch with fellows from different programs with similar interests, such as environmental issues, volunteering and community, public health, youth at risk, people with disabilities, and more. Those interested in art were able to browse an online gallery of artwork produced by Mandel fellows.<br><br></p>

<p>One of the day’s highlights was a special conversation between 
   <strong>Yael Lautman Offir</strong>, human resources consultant for the Mandel Foundation–Israel, and 
   <strong>Professor Jehuda Reinharz</strong>, president of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation. Professor Reinharz spoke about the late Morton Mandel from his personal perspective as both Mort’s colleague and as someone from whom he learned a great deal.&nbsp;He described their first meeting, their close relationship over the years, and their last conversation just before Mort passed away. At the end of the session, Professor Reinharz fielded questions from fellows.</p>
<p>In the feedback questionnaires completed after the event, the participants expressed a high level of satisfaction. They reported that the Fellows’ Day allowed them to become more familiar with the various areas of activity of the Foundation’s units and programs, introduced them to the dilemmas and challenges faced by those units and programs, and in particular, gave them a greater sense of belonging to the Foundation and a feeling that each and every one of them is “part of something great.”<br><br></p>
