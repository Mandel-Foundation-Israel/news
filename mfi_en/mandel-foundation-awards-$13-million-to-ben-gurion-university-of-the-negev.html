                                            <p>Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) announces the gift of $ 13,106,700 from 
the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation in Cleveland, Ohio. The gift is 
comprised of a capital grant of $10 million to construct a new building - the 
Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Institute for Social Leadership. An additional 
$3,106,700 will establish the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Honors Program in 
Social Leadership, which will be housed in the new building.<br><br>The Jack, 
Joseph and Morton Mandel Honors Program in Social Leadership will incorporate 
the current academic MBA program in social leadership, the Israel Center for 
Third-Sector Research and the eventual executive programs that will all be under 
the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Institute for Social Leadership.</p>
<p>Morton L. Mandel, Foundation Chairman and CEO, remarks, “As part of our 
long-term relationship with Ben-Gurion University, the Mandel Foundation 
welcomes the opportunity to assist the University in further developing the area 
of social leadership. This gift represents our desire to support Ben-Gurion 
University, the city of Beer-Sheva, and the advancement of social leadership in 
Israel.”<br><br>This new building will be located on BGU’s Marcus Family Campus 
in Beer Sheva, Israel, adjacent to the Guilford Glazer Faculty of Business and 
Management. The 40,000 square foot building, designed by Plesner Architects of 
Tel Aviv, will house classrooms, studios, offices, auditoriums and research 
facilities, addressing BGU’s academic needs to further develop the area of 
social leadership.<br><br>The Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Honors Program in 
Social Leadership will incorporate both the current academic MBA program in 
social leadership and the Israel Center for Third-Sector Research. The 
additional funds will allow for expansion of the program. The purpose of the 
Mandel Honors Program in Social Leadership is to teach students within the 
Guilford Glazer Faculty of Business and Management, including students enrolled 
in other business programs, relevant business administration, social 
responsibility and social leadership skills.<br><br>"This magnanimous gift 
incorporates the founding vision of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev to be 
involved with and make a difference in the community,” says University President 
Prof. Rivka Carmi. “We are inspired by Mort Mandel's vision and his personal 
hands-on involvement that embodies all the characteristics of social leadership 
that we hope to instill in the next generation, and I thank him with all my 
heart for helping us realize this dream." <br>&nbsp;<br>Prof. Amos Drory, vice 
president for external affairs and one of the founders and former deans of the 
Guilford Glazer Faculty of Business and Management, adds, “This donation has 
made it possible to create the highest quality educational program to train the 
next generation of nonprofit managers while broadening the scope of research in 
the field and make a real impact on the quality of NGO [non-governmental 
organization] management in Israel. This is the Mandel Foundation’s unique 
vision and this is likewise part of our DNA.&nbsp; A perfect match!” </p>

<p><strong>About the programs<br><br></strong>Social leadership requires the 
integration of advanced management knowledge, leadership skills and a deep 
commitment to social improvement. The objective of the Jack, Joseph and Morton 
Mandel MBA Program in Social Leadership is to train and develop top leaders for 
the nonprofit and public sectors in Israel. The MBA Program in Social Leadership 
is unique&nbsp;- it is the only master’s degree program of its kind in any Israeli 
university. The curriculum includes standard MBA courses in management and 
courses that focus on the special challenges of leadership in the nonprofit and 
public sectors.<br><br>Established in 1997, the Israel Center for Third-Sector 
Research (ICTR) conducts policy-relevant research on Israel’s nonprofit sector. 
Composed of an interdisciplinary team, ICTR works in close cooperation with 
research centers and associations around the world.</p>
