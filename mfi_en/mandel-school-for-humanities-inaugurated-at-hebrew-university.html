                   The Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel School for Advanced Studies in the Humanities at the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University will be home to the Mandel-Scholion Center, as well as to honors programs, advanced degree students and fellows in the humanities, senior researchers and recipients of major research grants. It aims to be the center of a dynamic and creative academic community in the Faculty of Humanities, contributing to the advancement of the humanities at the Hebrew University as well as in Israeli and international societies. Activities at the Mandel School take place in cross-disciplinary, multi-age research groups, in which the best students in master's and PhD programs will work alongside post-doctoral researchers in a mutually reinforcing, intellectually enriching, friendly work environment. In this way, the Mandel School strives to prepare the best researchers for the next generation, while serving as a model for an integrated graduate school both at the Hebrew University and at other universities in Israel.</p>
