            <div class="article-body">
                <div class="article-content">
                                            <div>On April 29, 2018, a reception was held in honor of 
   <strong>Mr. Morton L. Mandel</strong>, chairman and CEO of the Jack, Joseph and Mandel Foundation, at the residence of 
   <strong>Mr. Reuven (Ruvi) Rivlin</strong>, President of the State of Israel.</div>
<div> 
   <br> 
</div>
<div>The reception, which took place on April 29, 2018, was also attended by 
   <strong>Professor Jehuda Reinharz</strong>, president of the Mandel Foundation; 
   <strong>Mr. Moshe Vigdor</strong>, director general of the Mandel Foundation-Israel; Knesset opposition leader 
   <strong>MK Isaac Herzog</strong>; past and present heads of academic institutions in Israel, and Mandel graduates.<br></div>
<div> 
   <br> 
</div>
<div>"As you know, Mr. President, since you graced us with your presence at the cornerstone ceremony," said 
   <strong>Professor Jehuda Reinharz</strong>, president of the Mandel Foundation, "we are now establishing our headquarters here in Jerusalem… This represents a commitment on the part of the Foundation to be here forever. We are a Jewish, Zionist organization, and we feel that finally establishing our headquarters here is a show of our commitment to the State of Israel and to the Jewish people."<br></div>

<div>"I have never heard of anyone… who has donated so much money to cultural, educational, and other good causes in Israel," said 
   <strong>Adv. Yehuda Raveh</strong>, legal adviser to the Mandel Foundation and a friend of Mr. Mandel. After wishing Mr. Mandel many more years of good health and giving, he added: "You are not only my mentor and friend, but you are also one of the greatest friends of the State of Israel and the Jewish people," he said.</div>
<div> 
   <br> 
</div>
<div>At the end of the reception, Mr. Mandel presented President Rivlin and his wife Nechama with a copy of the second Hebrew edition of his book, 
   <em>It's All About Who</em>, and read out the inscription that he had written:</div>
<div> 
   <br> 
</div>
<blockquote style="margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;border:none;padding:0px;"><div>
      <em>Dear President Rivlin,</em></div><div>
      <em><br></em></div><div>
      <em>My personal thanks and appreciation for your gracious hospitality and also for your continuing support for the Mandel Foundation. My thanks also and appreciation for all your efforts to make Israel a better place for all its citizens.</em></div></blockquote>
<div> 
   <br> 
</div>
<div>After receiving the new edition of the book, President Rivlin told Mr. Mandel that when he had read the first edition, he came to the understanding that good leaders are people who create followers, while great leaders are people who create leaders.&nbsp; "You have taught us how to create leaders," he said to Mr. Mandel. "I hope you will create more leaders," he continued, "because we need a lot of leaders to help the people of Israel carry all the burdens on our shoulders."&nbsp;</div>
<div> 
   <br> 
</div>
<div>As the event drew to a close, President Rivlin said to Mr. Mandel: "Giving compliments is not easy for me, but I really believe that you are a great Jew and a great human being." The President concluded by thanking Mr. Mandel for all that he is doing on behalf of the Jewish people and the State of Israel – especially for Israel's children, universities, and the residents of the South – and for honoring the President's Residence with his presence.<br></div>
