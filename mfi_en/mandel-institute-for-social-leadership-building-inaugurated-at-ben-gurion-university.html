<div>“It is all about people,” said 
   <strong>Ben-Gurion University President Rivka Carmi</strong>. “This is not only the name of the book written by Mort Mandel. It is his managerial skills, and style, the way he chooses his partners and friends, his way of life.” She thanked the Mandel Foundation Chairman for his partnership and friendship, stating “your generosity, but moreover, your wise guidance, and clear insights… are a once in a lifetime kind of experience for me, an incredible, outstanding inspiration.”</div>
<div> 
   <br> 
</div>
<div>Extolling Mr. Mandel for his outstanding contribution to the city of Beer Sheva, 
   <strong>Beer Sheva Mayor Ruvik Danilovich</strong> said: “It’s symbolic that we are inaugurating this building at Ben-Gurion University, right next to Ben-Gurion Boulevard here in Beer Sheva. There are no greater partners in the vision for Beer Sheva than Ben-Gurion and Mort Mandel.” Turning to the students of the Institute, he added: “To be a graduate of this program means that there are high expectations of you to take charge and to do something. Something for the good of the city, something for the good of the country, something for the good of Israeli society, something for the good of the world.”</div>
<div> 
   <br> 
</div>
<div>“This is a very wonderful moment for me,” said 
   <strong>Mandel Foundation Chairman Morton L. Mandel</strong> in response. “I’m thanking you because what you are doing is making my dream come true.”</div>
<div> ​ </div>
<div>Located on the Western edge of the University’s campus, the beautiful new building was designed by Plesner Architects, and combines functionality with aesthetics. Its proximity to the public housing projects of the Dalet neighborhood of Beer Sheva is not coincidental; rather, it aims to strengthen the connection between academic studies and the needs of the field.</div>

<div>Additional highlights of the event included the inauguration of the Simon and Rose Mandel Garden, named after the parents of Jack, Joseph, and Morton Mandel; a ribbon cutting ceremony, the presentation of the key to the building to Mr. Morton Mandel, and a ceremony in which a mezuzah was affixed to the new building.</div>
<div>
   <br>
</div>
<div>Prior to the dedication of the building and the garden, a time capsule with documentation of joint endeavors of the Mandel Foundation and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev was stored in the building. The time capsule will be opened in 2066.</div>

<div>The inauguration was followed by a graduation ceremony for the students of the third graduating class of the Mandel ​Social MBA Program, who have already begun to lead social initiatives in the Negev.</div>
