<p>Based in Cleveland, Ohio, the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation was founded in 1953 and has been operating in Israel for the last 30 years. With its Israel headquarters in Jerusalem, the Foundation has invested more than NIS 1.5 billion in Israel to date. The Foundation has four units that conduct leadership programs in Israel: the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, the Mandel Leadership Institute, the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev, and the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North. The current donation, like the Foundation's many donations over the years, is an expression of the Mandel Foundation’s commitment to the welfare of Israeli society and to the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.<br><br></p>
