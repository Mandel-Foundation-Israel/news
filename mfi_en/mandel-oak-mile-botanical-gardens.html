                                            <p>​At a festive ceremony held on a beautiful new deck, the Morton L. Mandel Oak Mile was dedicated at the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens on November 1, 2018. The ceremony was attended by 
   <strong>Morton L. Mandel</strong>, chairman and CEO of the Mandel Foundation; 
   <strong>Mr. Alan Berkley</strong>, chairman of the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens; 
   <strong>Professor Jehuda Reinharz</strong>, president of the Mandel Foundation; 
   <strong>Mr. Stephen Hoffman</strong>, vice chairman of the Mandel Foundation; and 
   <strong>Mr. Moshe Vigdor</strong>, director general of the Mandel Foundation-Israel. Faculty, senior staff, and friends of the Mandel Foundation-Israel rounded out the well-wishers assembled.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Mr. Tom Amit</strong>, director general of the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens welcomed all those in attendance and expressed his happiness that the permanent home of the Mandel Foundation in Jerusalem is being built adjacent to the Botanical Gardens. He was followed by 
   <strong>Dr. Ori Fragman-Sapir</strong>, the scientific director of the Gardens, who spoke about the oak tree, which he considers the most important tree in Israel, America, Europe, and Asia.<br><br></p>

<p>“I am pleased and proud to be here," said 
   <strong>Morton L. Mandel</strong> in response to the recognition he received. "This garden is more than a thing of beauty; it is a work in progress that's helping to maintain a living history of nature.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the ceremony, three Ohio Buckeyes – the official tree of the state of Ohio – were planted in honor of three inspiring brothers: Jack, Joseph, and Morton Mandel. The trees, which will be displayed in a location at the junction of the future Mandel campus and the Botanical Gardens, symbolize the shared commitment of the Mandel Foundation and the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens to the city of Jerusalem, to excellence and education, and to creating a more just, compassionate, and inclusive society in Israel.<br></p>
