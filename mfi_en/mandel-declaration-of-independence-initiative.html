<p>Morton L. Mandel, the founder and first CEO of the Mandel Foundationâ€“Israel, saw the establishment of the State of Israel as a miracle, and repeated this sentiment often. He loved Israel and was passionately devoted to the State.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This commitment was expressed by Mort Mandel and his brothers Jack and Joseph through their generous support for the State of Israel and various enterprises in Israel, which included the establishment of the Mandel Foundationâ€“Israel as a Jewish, Zionist Foundation that would engage in meaningful, valuable and impactful activity for the benefit of Israeli society.</p>
<p>In honor of Israelâ€™s 75th birthday, the Mandel Foundationâ€“Israel decided to present the people of Israel with a copy of the Israeli Declaration of Independence â€“ the official proclamation of the State of Israel. A scanned facsimile of the original Hebrew declaration was included with the weekend editions and Independence Day supplements of all major newspapers in Israel, bringing the document into all homes, to be kept for posterity, as testimony to the miracle of the establishment of the State. The Foundation also made a digital version of the original Hebrew document available on this website. The initiative was accompanied by radio announcements and banners on the Internet.</p>
<p>This undertaking is a reaffirmation of the Mandel Foundationâ€™s unswerving, ongoing commitment to the State of Israel, in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence and the vision of Morton Mandel and his brothers.</p>
<p>Israel is currently in the midst of trying times. The Declaration of Independence is a formative and unifying document that brings people together in affirming the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.</p>
