                                            <p>The spread of the coronavirus in Israel has confused and disrupted our daily routines, challenged us both on a personal and collective level, and brought us great uncertainty as to what the future holds. Since the outbreak of the epidemic, the entire country has transitioned to a state of routine emergency, and the times demand that we must adapt our methods for maintaining social cohesion and mutual support.</p>
<p>The Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev is developing ways to continue our regular operations while dealing with the situation in the long term. We rapidly moved over to digital platforms, which provide a stable infrastructure for teaching and mentoring fellows, and adapted our learning to the new circumstances. </p>
<p>Designed to promote the resilience and wellbeing of our fellows and graduates, this series of lectures by Professor Smadar Ben Asher, a faculty member of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev, is an additional component of our activities during this period. We are delighted to make this series of short Hebrew videos on the following topics available to the Mandel community and to the general public: </p>
<ol><li>Coping with extended periods of routine emergency</li><li>Resilience</li><li>Methods for coping with stressful situations</li><li>Principles of intervention following traumatic events.<br></li></ol>
