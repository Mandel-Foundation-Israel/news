<p><br>In early February, 
   <strong>Stephen Hoffman</strong>, chairman of the Mandel Foundation, 
   <strong>Professor Jehuda Reinharz</strong>, president of the Foundation, and 
   <strong>Moshe Vigdor</strong>, director general of the Mandel Foundation–Israel, visited the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev and spoke with the fellows of its regional program for leaders in the Bedouin sector about their daily work and the leadership challenges they face.</p>
<p>
         <strong>Kassim Alsraiha</strong>, director of the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in Kseifa and Arara BaNegev, opened the visit by presenting an overview of Arab Bedouin society in the Negev and of the social, cultural, and structural changes currently underway. The Mandel Foundation leadership then toured the Al-Mustaqbal elementary and junior high school in the village of Abu Talul, which is part of the Neve Midbar Regional Council. There they met with teachers and students, were introduced to the school’s music club, and met with members of the Abu Talul Scouts. They spoke with the school principal, 
         <strong>Kamal Abu-Haduba</strong>, who is a fellow of the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in Kseifa and Arara BaNegev and the recipient of the President’s Israeli Hope Prize for Education for 2017–2018. Kamal described the challenges he faces on a daily basis, and explained how the school serves as a meeting place for students on the weekends, when it offers informal education activities.</p>
<p>Next, the visitors met with the program fellows and heard about their work in the educational, social, and public arenas, with special emphasis on the practical aspects of their work. Faculty member 
         <strong>Dr. Rotem Bresler-Gonen</strong> presented the rationale for the unique model chosen for this program. This component is based on the development of high-quality position papers on education, health, and civil society, which the fellows are developing in work teams, guided by mentoring. The Foundation’s leadership stressed the importance of initiatives in the Negev, and encouraged the fellows to continue their fruitful efforts to improve quality of life for residents of the Negev.<br><br></p>
