<p>The participants told Mr. Mandel about the in-depth learning they experienced during the program, which included clarifying their values and identity, engaging in philosophical studies, and more. They also described their work as leaders in the Negev, and shared some of the social and economic challenges they are addressing in the fields such as education, community, employment, and tourism.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Dr. Adi Nir-Sagi</strong>, director of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev, expressed her gratitude for the opportunity to learn from Mr. Mandel and to participate in an inspirational discussion.</p>
<p>This session marked the conclusion of the fellows’ two-year learning journey as part of the Mandel Program for Local Leadership in Yeruham and Ramat Hanegev, under the direction of 
   <strong>Dr. Itzhak (Kiki) Aharonovich</strong> and 
   <strong>Dr. Noa Milman</strong>. In closing, the fellows thanked Mr. Mandel for the enlightening and moving session. He responded by asking them all to continue their work, to implement what they had learned in order to impact their communities, and – step by step – to make the Negev a better, more flourishing place for all its residents.<br></p>
