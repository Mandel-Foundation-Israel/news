                                            <p>​The third meeting of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev's "Negev Lab" series – a forum for collaborative study and thinking about culture, art, and identity in the Negev – hosted Adar Secker, an architect and expert in urban planning, who gave a lecture on culture and urbanism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By means of a review of the theories and principles of urban crowding, Secker explained the connection between high population density and the potential for the development of local culture. According to his presentation, public spaces facilitate random meetings between people, the creation of culture, and access to culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The meeting was attended by leading figures from local government, public institutions, and cultural organizations that are active in local arts in the Negev. Informative and fruitful, the meeting provided an opportunity for continued discussion and collaborative thinking about fostering culture in the Negev and about related local leadership challenges.</p>
<p>The “Negev Lab" series, led by Dr. Ruth Calderon and Dr. Adi Nir Sagi, is a forum in which leaders and key figures from the Negev region come together to share inspiration and study issues related to local culture and artistic creativity.<br><br></p>
