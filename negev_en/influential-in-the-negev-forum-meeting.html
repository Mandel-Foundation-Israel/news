                                            <p style="text-align:justify;color:#333333;line-height:19.06px;font-family:arial;font-size:14.66px;background-color:#ffffff;">On October 3, 2013, the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev (MCLN) hosted a gathering of the “Influential in the Negev” forum, which brings together prominent activists in the Negev, including non-profit directors, businessmen, local authority heads, industrialists, key third-sector figures, and social leaders from all spheres. As part of the program, a panel took place on “Gaps in Influence in the Negev” – referring to the disparity between the desire and the ability to influence decision makers in Israel. The panel consisted of Rina Matzliach, Channel 2 political correspondent; Tzvika Alush, owner of a media consultancy firm; Shmulik David, a consultant on policy change at SHATIL; and former Knesset members Taleb a-Sana and Haim Oron.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;color:#333333;line-height:19.06px;font-family:arial;font-size:14.66px;background-color:#ffffff;">Following the panel discussion, three new Negev-related social projects were presented: Negev Jobs, a classified ads site for Negev businesses and residents; a venture founded by Bedouin high-tech entrepreneur Ibrahim Sana to outsource software testing to Bedouin in the Negev with the aim of helping them integrate into Israeli’s high-tech market; and a social construction initiative that entails setting up construction non-profits in conjunction with contractors, entrepreneurs, and local authorities to create affordable housing options for Negev residents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;color:#333333;line-height:19.06px;font-family:arial;font-size:14.66px;background-color:#ffffff;">The “Influential in the Negev” forum, whose roughly 90 members meet once every two months, was established to generate a dialogue that reflects the complex, unique, diverse voice of the Negev. At the gatherings, forum members discuss a range of topics relevant to the Negev, participate in field trips, and get to know the Negev in all its shapes and colors: visually, on foot, and through discourse. In addition, the forum promotes projects suggested by its members by networking between interested parties, offering support at various stages of the project, and providing a set of organizational tools tailored to the needs of entrepreneurs and their initiatives. The five core organizations of the forum are: SHATIL (The New Israel Fund Initiative for Social Change); MIFAM (centers for organizational training and development in local authorities); AJEEC-Negev Institute for Strategies of Peace and Development; the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev; and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.</p>
