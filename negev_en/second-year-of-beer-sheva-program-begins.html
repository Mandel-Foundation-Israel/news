The 21 fellows of the cohort 3 of the Mandel program for local leadership in Beer Sheva have begun their second year of studies. This year’s program will include peer learning on a variety of subjects in a unit called “Fellows Teach,” as well as lectures, workshops, field trips, and a fellows’ retreat currently scheduled to be held in Akko in December.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
One of the innovations to the program this year will be a small-group learning process that every two weeks will take on a new subject, proposed by the fellows, and for each subject will include one session of research and theoretical study and one session for developing practical applications.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
This second year of the program will be characterized by more active participation and leadership by the fellows, from taking part in planning elements of the study program to taking responsibility for study activities that will be initiated and led by the group.
