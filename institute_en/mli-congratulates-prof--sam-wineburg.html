                   The Mandel Leadership Institute congratulates <b>Prof. Sam Wineburg</b>, a member of the Mandel Leadership Institute's Academic Advisory Committee and an MLI visiting faculty member, on his election to the <b>American National Academy of Education</b> (NAEd). 
                </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
                    The National Academy of Education advances high quality education research and its use in policy formation and practice. The Academy consists of U.S. members and foreign associates who are elected on the basis of outstanding scholarship related to education. Since its establishment in 1965, the Academy has undertaken research studies that address pressing issues in education, which are typically conducted by members and other scholars. In addition, the ​​​Academy sponsors professional development fellowship programs that contribute to the preparation of the next generation of scholars.
                </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
                    Prof. Wineburg, one of 16 exceptional scholars elected to the Academy this year, is the Margaret Jacks Professor of Education at Stanford University. Wineburg, who began his career as a history teacher, is an educational psychologist and one of the world's leading experts on how history is taught and learned. His focus includes the nature and development of historical thinking, new forms of educational assessment, the gap between research and what actually reaches practitioners, and the technological tools that might bridge this gap. His book, <em>Historical Thinking and Other Unnatural Acts: Charting the Future of Teaching the Past,</em> won the 2001 Frederic W. Ness Award from the Association of American Universities for work that makes the most important contribution to the “improvement of Liberal Education and understanding the Liberal Arts.”
