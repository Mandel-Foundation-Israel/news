                                            <p>Fainy Sukenik, a fellow of cohort 2 of the Mandel Programs for Leadership Development in the Haredi (Ultra-Orthodox) Community, has been chosen as one of 14 honored citizens to light a torch at the opening ceremony for Israel’s 68th Independence Day, this year marking “Civic Heroism.”</p>
<p>Fainy is the founder and volunteer director of the Ba’asher Telchi [“Wherever You Go”] non-profit organization, which offers emotional, social, and legal support for Haredi women going through separation and divorce proceedings. She set up the organization after her own divorce, during which she encountered first-hand the difficulties facing Haredi women during this process. Fainy holds a bachelor’s degree in school counseling, works as a school counselor, and is studying for her master’s in educational counseling at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>We congratulate Fainy on this honor recognizing her work and her civic heroism.</p>
