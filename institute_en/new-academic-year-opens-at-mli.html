                                            <p>The 2013-14 academic year was launched at the Mandel Leadership Institute on September 2 with a celebratory opening ceremony and lecture.</p>
<p>The 15 fellows of cohort 21 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, now entering their second year of studies, have been joined by 20 new fellows of cohort 22, and also by the four new fellows of cohort 4 of the Mandel Scholars in Education Program. Welcoming addresses to the fellows were given by Moshe Vigdor, director general of the Mandel Foundation-Israel, Dr. Eli Gottlieb, director of MLI and vice-president of the Mandel Foundation-Israel, and Danny Bar-Giora, director of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership.</p>
<p>Fellows and faculty then heard a lecture from Prof. Ariel Hirschfeld, who has joined MLI as a visiting faculty member for 2013-14, on the subject of “<em>Shvarim</em> and <em>Teruah</em>” (two of the types of sounds made with a ram’s horn on the Jewish New Year), in which Ariel reviewed approaches to literary openings in Hebrew literature, from the bible through the Middle Ages and to our times.</p>
<p>Subsequently the fellows, faculty and staff of the Mandel Leadership Institute gathered for a toast to the new year, and for some <a href="http://en-leadershipmatters.blogspot.co.il/2013/09/heads-and-tails-new-years-greeting.html" target="_blank"> new year’s blessings</a> from Dr. Eli Gottlieb.</p>
