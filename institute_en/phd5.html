   <strong>Akiva Hameiri</strong> is a doctoral student at the Melton Centre for Jewish Education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem’s school of education. Akiva holds a bachelor’s degree in Bible and Jewish studies and a master’s degree in Jewish education, both from the Hebrew University. His doctoral research focus is a study of the development of the characters of Esau and Zippora in the biblical story and in Midrashim as a window into the cultural treatment of the foreigner and its possible implications on Jewish education. His advisors are Prof. Menachem Hirshman of the Jewish education department and Prof. Israel Knohl of the Bible studies department. Akiva teaches Bible and serves as chair of the Jewish philosophy concentration at the Yigal Allon High School in Rishon LeZion. He is also a counselor at the Posen Foundation, working with youth who are studying questions of identity and the attitude towards foreigners in Jewish sources. Akiva is a member of a research group at the Shaharit Institute, which addresses the image of a liberal and multicultural society in Israel.</p>
