                                            <p>On Tuesday, February 26, during the Mandel Leadership Institute's weekly "tea time" gathering, faculty and fellows said farewell to Dr. Ruth Calderon, a&nbsp;faculty member of the Mandel Leadership Institute&nbsp;and graduate of the first cohort of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, who was elected to the 19th Knesset on the "Yesh Atid" party list.</p>
<p>Dr. Eli Gottlieb, director of the Mandel Leadership Institute, congratulated Dr. Calderon on her election to the Knesset and wished her success in her challenging new role. He also presented her with a (symbolic) flak jacket to help her deal with the struggles that lie ahead of her in the Knesset.</p>
<p>In her moving first speech in the Knesset plenum, which made waves both in Israel and throughout the international Jewish community, MK Calderon, a scholar of Talmud and Rabbinic literature, spoke of her family's history and her love for Talmud.</p>
