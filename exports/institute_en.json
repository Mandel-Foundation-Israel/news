Moderated by journalist and television personality Roni Kuban, the panel was made up of musician and author Ariel Horowitz; translator and director Eli Bijaoui; comedian Henya Shochat; and journalist Chen Artzi Sror, director of the Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture, who stated that we should be talking not only about rights but also about belonging, because people want to feel that they belong and want recognition for the values of family and homeland. The panelists told stories, argued, and shared their pains, fears and hopes for the future.\nPrior to the panel, actors from the Nissan Nativ Acting Studio performed short scenes related to the social struggle, which enriched the evening and demonstrated the ability of art to deepen social discourse. The panel was followed by roundtable discussions in which the panelists discussed the issues raised with students and faculty members of Nissan Nativ.\n\n\nThe students and leadership of the participating institutions thanked the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel for fostering discourse on the current challenges faced by Israeli society.

The border areas and seamlines in Jerusalem manifest themselves in different ways. They provide opportunities for encounters between different faiths, values, historical accounts, and interest groups; raise a variety of human and ethical issues; are often the focus of a great deal of tension; and call for acts of leadership.\nThe seamlines of Jerusalem were the focus of a joint study day for all the fellows of the Mandel Leadership Institute, who come from different communities and sectors in Israeli society, and include leaders from the Haredi community, non-formal education, the world of Jewish culture, the Israel Defense Forces, and teacher education programs at universities and colleges. The Institute\u2019s joint study days create an enriching professional environment for the fellows, introduce them to the various areas in which the Institute\u2019s programs operate, and create opportunities for encounters and discussions between fellows of different programs. These events strengthen fellows\u2019 knowledge of fundamental issues in Israeli society and facilitate challenging discussions of core conflictual topics, as part of the leadership development process.\nIn the second joint study day of the year, the Institute\u2019s fellows embarked on field trips in mixed groups of fellows from different programs, and explored case studies that showcase tensions or conflicts in Jerusalem. Examining these cases, while referring to the fellows\u2019 professional experience in their own work environments, provided the basis for a discussion that centered around principles of leadership, particularly leadership that is aware of the complexities in which it operates. The tours served as a pedagogy for facilitating deep understanding and contemplation within the seam areas themselves, and the emerging insights created new and enriching links to the world of practice. As one of the fellows described it: \u201cI only hear about the places we visited on the news. I never imagined that I would actually walk through them myself, and think about the conflict in such a clear manner.\u201d By means of the tours, and the discussions that followed, the fellows were able to express their feelings, and spoke about the need to take responsibility.\nThe tours in which the fellows participated included the following:\nA visit to the Temple Mount \u2013 Led by a pair of guides, one Jewish and one Arab, the Institute\u2019s fellows visited the Temple Mount, one of the most contested places in the world in terms of inter-religious frictions and attempts to challenge boundaries. There, they explored how the political, religious, and social boundaries on and around the Temple Mount are set and tested, and how the shared spaces of this tiny area with an immense global impact are managed.\nMount Herzl \u2013 Fellows toured Israel\u2019s national military cemetery at Mount Herzl, where they delved into lesser-known stories of those who are buried there and explored questions of inclusion in and exclusion from national memory \u2013 questions with dynamic answers that shift in accordance with social attitudes during\u00a0different eras. Led by Aviv Wishkovsky, a guide who researches the formation of collective memory in Israeli society, the tour focused on the process by which Mount Herzl was designed and explored the development of memory and the boundaries that have been placed on it by the shapers of Israeli statehood and national culture since the establishment of the State.\n\n\nAlong the tracks \u2013 Fellows rode Jerusalem\u2019s light rail, led by Dr. Marik Shtern, a geographer who studies cities in conflict, urban politics, and relations between groups in urban spaces. Jerusalem\u2019s light rail, which connects opposite ends of the city, passes through various different border areas. The interfaces between different worlds within Jerusalem, interwoven along the track, offer a fascinating glimpse of the city\u2019s complexity. Getting on and off the train at various stops, the fellows were shown how borders in Jerusalem can be historical, religious, or in people\u2019s minds, and discovered that while the city\u2019s walls may be solid or transparent, they are very much present at all times. In the words of one participant: \u201cIt\u2019s a light railway \u2013 but nothing about it is light or easy.\u201d\nNatural and urban spaces \u2013 One group of fellows set out on a bicycle tour that explored the borders between natural and urban spaces within Jerusalem, and examined the social, educational, and physical consequences of crossing these borders. Conducted on a cycle path that surrounds the city, this tour facilitated a different form of movement through the cityscapes.\n\nThroughout the tours, the fellows encountered different expressions of the Psalmist\u2019s reference to Jerusalem as \u201ca city joined together\u201d (Psalm 122). On the one hand, they saw the mixing of identities and meeting points, while on the other, they saw the fraying of relations, up to a point of clash and conflict. These encounters embodied the yearning expressed by the Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai, a longtime resident of Jerusalem, in his poem \u201cWhy Is Jerusalem Always Two?\u201d:\n\u201cWhy is Jerusalem always two, one above and one below?And I want to live in the Jerusalem in the middle,Without banging my head up top,And without bruising\u00a0my feet down below.\u201d\nFor the Institute\u2019s fellows, there was great value in meeting the fellows of the Institute\u2019s parallel programs, whether in the tour groups or in the discussion groups that followed. The encounters allowed them to discuss issues of leadership in areas of conflict from very different perspectives, to broaden their viewpoints, and to shine a light on their blind spots. The encounters were an opportunity for fellows to step out of their comfort zones and hold discussions that were very fruitful, even if occasionally heated. These discussions gave rise to new connections, through which fellows could examine the social arenas in which they want to have an impact, and the type and extent of the impact they want to achieve. This allowed them to create potential partnerships that will help them cope with similar challenges in different fields of activity in the future.\n","html_content":"<p>The city of Jerusalem is a microcosm of Israeli society, with its many diverse groups, and includes multiple \u201cborder areas\u201d along various dividing lines \u2013 religious, social, cultural, political, demographic, symbolic, and more.

One of the sessions explored the ways in which media professionals shape the news and provided insights on how to become smarter users of mass media.

Held in cooperation with the Council for Youth and Children Organizations and the National Association of Youth Department Directors, this initiative was designed to enable the participants to learn together about the work being done in this field both in Israel and around the world and to derive insights that would increase the strength and influence of the non-formal education system in the State of Israel.\nThe conference, held at the Mandel Leadership Institute in Jerusalem in June 2021, brought together pre-selected representatives of youth departments in Israel\u2019s local authorities as well as directors of national children and youth organizations. The initiative explored test cases in three municipalities: Daliyat al-Karmel, Ashdod, and Bat Yam. The day of collaborative thinking included joint study, understanding the challenges, and developing methods for addressing the challenges in the best way possible.\n\n\nThe collaborative process that took place is an outgrowth of a view that sees non-formal education as an ecosystem whose parts must be connected to form a full picture \u2013 an approach that the Mandel Youth Leadership Program promotes as part of its goals. These goals include building communities of diverse leaders who come from the field of non-formal education and work both together and separately to strengthen values-based education, social solidarity, and equal opportunity; increasing the influence of non-formal education; and giving every child in Israel the opportunity to participate in high-quality education that is individually tailored to his or her needs.\nThe Mandel Leadership Institute is working on this initiative together with national organizations that do hands-on work in the field of non-formal education. Among these is the Council for Youth and Children Organizations, an umbrella organization that brings together 20 organizations for children and youth that serve more than 150,000 children and young adults and are responsible for more than 1,000 National Service volunteers.

Part of the strategic collaboration between the Mandel Leadership Institute and the Ministry of Education, the summit was attended by the presidents and rectors of the 21 colleges of education in Israel, as well as the heads of schools of education and of teacher training programs at the country\u2019s nine research universities. This was the first time that representatives of all these institutions \u2013 universities and colleges large and small, in the center of the country and the outlying regions, secular, religious, Jewish and Arab \u2013 came together to discuss contemporary challenges and explore the deep connections between education and society.\nThese academic leaders were joined by senior representatives of the Ministry of Education and members of staff from various programs of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel. Spanning three days, the summit was held at the Mandel Foundation building in Jerusalem and at Kibbutz Kfar Blum.\nThe added value that the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel brings to an event of this nature is its longstanding and in-depth engagement with the major questions that are of concern to Israeli society. The summit focused on the role of teacher education in advancing social cohesion and resilience in Israel. The choice of topic was based on the understanding that the teachers and preschool teachers of the future have a key role to play in addressing the processes of social polarization that have been accelerating against the backdrop of tectonic changes in Israeli democracy. This complex, overarching theme was explored via three axes of investigation: humanity, society, and knowledge. These are vital arenas on which education has critical influence.\nThe humanity axis examined the challenge posed by the decline in the status of the humanities in academia and the erosion of the place of humanist ideas in the academic education of teachers in Israel. In this realm, the participants watched a conversation between Professor Martha Nussbaum of the University of Chicago and Professor Yuli Tamir of Beit Berl College. Professor Nussbaum argued that education should nurture three key human attributes: the Socratic method of thinking, historical consciousness, and the use of imagination. Following this discussion, the participants visited Natur, a mixed religious-secular pre-military leadership academy in the Golan Heights, where they met with young people who are engaged in full-time study of philosophical and Jewish texts.\nThe society axis examined the challenge posed by the deep social gaps in Israel and the segregation between educational streams. A panel discussion was held with Rafik Halabi, the head of the Daliyat al-Karmel local council, Professor Gad Yair of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Professor Zipora Libman, president of the Kibbutzim College of Education, and Professor Yehezkel Taler, president of the Gordon College of Education. The panelists spoke about the role of education and academia in fostering social mobility and healing social rifts. The summit participants were then invited to participate in tours led by individuals who grew up in Israel\u2019s northern periphery and now work to advance social causes in the region.\nThe knowledge axis explored changes related to knowledge in the digital age and the difficulty of distinguishing fact from fiction (\u201cfake news\u201d). Professor Karine Nahon, head of the Data, Government and Democracy program at IDC Herzliya and president of the Israel Internet Association spoke about these topics with Professor Danah Boyd of the University of New York, who is the founder of Data & Society, a New-York based research institute. The two professors discussed efforts to address the rising extremism that characterizes rhetoric on social media and to strengthen social infrastructures and human networks at a local level, as a way of increasing trust. To experience the subject first-hand, the participants investigated the competing narratives regarding the production of sustainable energy in the Golan Heights, toured the actual sites at the heart of the controversy, and had a virtual tour of the influence groups involved.\nIn addition to the aforementioned elements of the program, participants took part in workshops and meetings with school principals and teachers, with fellows of the Mandel Program for Academic Leadership in Teacher Education, with Mandel faculty members, and with experts in the fields of management and leadership. Workshop topics included horizontal leadership, swarm leadership, design leadership, and storytelling. Participants also worked on translating the insights gained from the summit into concrete organizational actions for their own institutions and on connecting these actions to the new policy directions of the Ministry of Education and the Council for Higher Education (CHE), which approved new guidelines for academic education for teachers and preschool teachers in February 2021. Representatives of the universities and colleges themselves were involved in planning the summit, and their ideas and responses were incorporated throughout the plenum sessions.\nThe summit received widespread positive feedback: A large majority of the participants said that addressing big questions has great relevance for their work and reported that they gained a great deal from the diverse pedagogies used at the summit. Many participants requested continuing contact and expressed a desire for future meetings in similar forums.\nIn the wake of the summit, there was a significant rise in interest in applying to the second cohort of the Mandel Program for Academic Leadership in Teacher Education which will be begin in January 2022. In addition, the heads of teacher education institutions promised support for initiatives that will be developed by Mandel fellows from the new cohort. The summit further strengthened the longstanding relationship between the Mandel Foundation and the Ministry of Education, and forged important new relationships between the Foundation and academic institutions for teacher education in Israel.\nTo visit the Summit's website, click here (Hebrew)\u00a0>>\n","html_content":"<p> \n   <br> \n<\/p>\n<p>The Summit for Executive Leadership of Teacher Education in Israel: Humanity, Society, and Knowledge in the Current Age \u2013 the first conference of its kind \u2013 brought together the senior leaders of all the academic institutions responsible for teacher education in Israel.

The culmination of the process was a hackathon on the relationship between the police and the Haredi community, which was held at the Mandel Leadership Institute.\n\nAt the beginning of March, Deputy Police Commissioner Yaakov Cohen presented a challenging request to the staff of the Mandel Program for Leadership Development in the Haredi Community: Having been appointed by the police commissioner to head a strategic team tasked with developing a plan of action to improve trust between the police and the Haredi community, Cohen sought assistance from the program and its graduates in preparing this plan. On the agenda: mapping the division between police and the Haredi community, formulating policy, and suggesting initiatives that could help bring change.\nThe staff and faculty of the Mandel Leadership Institute undertook to examine how the program and graduates could best help the police. It was decided that the faculty and staff would hold a series of consultations with relevant graduates, in order to formulate a list of recommendations. Whenever possible or relevant, these consultations would also include representatives of the police work team and other relevant participants. The process is being led by Dr. Aviad Hollander, a member of the teaching faculty of the Mandel Program for Leadership Development in the Haredi Community who is responsible for the program\u2019s graduate activities.\nIn addition to in-depth conversations with graduates and various other figures in Haredi society, more than 60 graduates completed a questionnaire that was distributed to the program\u2019s graduate community. The responses described the barriers to building trust between the police and the Haredi community, based on the respondents\u2019 professional experience and personal familiarity with the various Haredi sub-groups. The respondents were also asked to suggest avenues of activity by the police and within the Haredi community that could help the police develop a strategic program to increase civilian security in Haredi society.\nThe analysis of the responses focused on five main assumptions underlying Haredi discourse on relations with the police:\nThe next stage in the process was running a hackathon brainstorming event in which small groups engaged in creative work on relations between the Israel Police and the Haredi community. Held on April 21, 2021 at the Mandel Foundation building in Jerusalem, the hackathon was planned and led by a team comprising Lior Peri, director of the Mandel IDF Educational Leadership Program; Nili Tal, an organizational consultant who is a faculty member of the Mandel IDF program and a personal tutor for the women\u2019s track of the Mandel Program for the Leadership Development in the Haredi Community; Rabbi Asher Melamed, who served for years as a rabbi in the Israel Police and now heads an organization focused on preventing sexual abuse and helping sexual abuse victims; and Benny Shachar, a fellow of the Mandel Program for Leadership Development in the Haredi Community and an officer in the Israel Police Behavioral Science Department.\nOver 40 graduates participated in the hackathon, alongside senior Israel police officers and senior officials from the Ministry of Public Security. At the beginning of the event, Yael Hess, director of the Mandel Leadership Institute, presented the rationale behind the Institute\u2019s operations. Deputy Police Commissioner Yaakov Cohen discussed the main challenges facing the police, and Dr. Naomi Perl, director of the Mandel Program for Leadership Development in the Haredi Community, described the main characteristics of the program\u2019s graduates and presented the goals of the hackathon. Dr. Aviad Hollander next presented relevant findings from the questionnaire. These included the high level of motivation that graduates have to play an active role in improving relations between the police and the Haredi community:\nNili Tal presented the principles of \u201cdesign thinking,\u201d on which the hackathon was based, and explained the working rules for the event. After brief personal introductions, which introduced the Mandel representatives and Police representatives, the participants split into two separate rooms.\nIn one room, Lior Peri and Naomi Perl led a discussion with officers of the Israel Police and representatives of the Ministry of Public Security. This forum heard from Fainy Sukenik, founder and director of Ba'asher Telchi, a non-profit organization that supports Haredi women in the process of divorce and a graduate of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, and Rabbi Menachem Bombach, director of the Netzach Haredi Educational Network and a senior staff member of the Mandel Leadership Institute, both of whom presented their achievements in the educational and social realms of the Haredi community as a model of effective field work by Mandel graduates.\n\nIn the second room, Nili Tal and Dr. Aviad Hollander led five parallel discussion groups, each of which explored one of five premises underlying Haredi discourse on relations with the police. The group members were asked to map the implications of these assumptions, the factors that might strengthen or weaken them, and the stakeholders invested in maintaining or changing the current situation. They were also asked which themes that emerged from their discussions are most important, and to suggest which avenues of implementation might be the most practicable. After the groups finished their deliberations, the police and ministry representatives joined the discussion groups to hear their conclusions and initial ideas for initiatives that might improve the situation. The main insights and proposals of the groups were then presented to the entire plenum by representatives of the groups and police officers.\nAt the conclusion of the event, Deputy Commissioner Cohen expressed his appreciation for the rapid and focused process, and requested practical recommendations based on the insights that had emerged. Aviad Hollander proposed holding further forums of representatives of the Haredi community and of the Israel Police that would focus on specific areas of activity.

On the agenda: mapping the division between police and the Haredi community, formulating policy, and suggesting initiatives that could help bring change.<\/p>\n<p>The staff and faculty of the Mandel Leadership Institute undertook to examine how the program and graduates could best help the police. It was decided that the faculty and staff would hold a series of consultations with relevant graduates, in order to formulate a list of recommendations.

The group members were asked to map the implications of these assumptions, the factors that might strengthen or weaken them, and the stakeholders invested in maintaining or changing the current situation. They were also asked which themes that emerged from their discussions are most important, and to suggest which avenues of implementation might be the most practicable. After the groups finished their deliberations, the police and ministry representatives joined the discussion groups to hear their conclusions and initial ideas for initiatives that might improve the situation. The main insights and proposals of the groups were then presented to the entire plenum by representatives of the groups and police officers.<\/p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the event, Deputy Commissioner Cohen expressed his appreciation for the rapid and focused process, and requested practical recommendations based on the insights that had emerged.

The Institute\u2019s leadership programs contain fellows from a diverse mix of communities and sectors in Israeli society, including leaders from the Haredi community, leaders of non-formal education, leaders in the field of Jewish culture in Israel, and IDF commanders.\nThe Institute\u2019s second joint study day of the 2020-2021 academic year, conducted on April 19, 2021, focused on issues related to public space in Jerusalem and explored the function of leadership along seam lines and in border areas.

Whether they are forced or voluntary, these encounters bring to the surface various human and ethical issues that demand acts of leadership.\nThe Institute\u2019s joint study day was designed to allow fellows to explore together the issue of border areas and its relevance to the question of leadership in Israeli society. The fellows set out on study tours, visiting different places in Jerusalem in order to investigate case studies of seam lines in the city in which there are tensions or conflicts, and through which it is possible to examine questions of leadership and how leadership operates in these unique spaces.\nThe guided tours were conducted in groups made up of fellows from the different programs of the Institute. Following each tour, discussions were held in which fellows spoke about the issues that currently concern them as leaders and about principles of leadership that consider the complex contexts in which the acts of leadership take place.\nThe following key issues were chosen as case studies:\nBetween Orthodoxies \u2013 The Temple Mount is one of the most sensitive locations in the world in terms of religious friction and attempts to challenge its borders. It is the holiest site in Judaism, the third holiest site in Islam, and a site of great importance to Christian tradition and belief. This tour explored the dynamic process by which political, religious, and social boundaries are formed and tested on and around the Temple Mount.\nMusrara through an artistic lens \u2013 Musrara is a seam line neighborhood in many senses: It lies on the border between East and West Jerusalem, it was home to the Black Panther protest movement against ethnic discrimination and inequality in Israel, and it is adjacent to the Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) neighborhood of Mea Shearim. This tour offered an artistic perspective on the political and social borders of Musrara through photography and music.\nSeam lines along King David Street \u2013 King David Street is home to a variety of physical and social borders. These include a sore spot in Mamilla, where disadvantaged populations who had lived on the frontline of the historical ceasefire line with Jordan were forcibly evacuated from their homes in order to transform the neighborhood into an upmarket outdoor mall; Machane Yisrael, a Moroccan neighborhood which played a vital role in the development of modern Jerusalem beyond the Old City walls, but which was left out of Israel\u2019s collective memory and its plans for historical preservation; Hebrew Union College, which brings together different denominations of Judaism and embodies the difficulty faced by the Reform movement, the central denomination in American Judaism, in coexisting with Israeli Orthodoxy, as seen from the building\u2019s architecture and location; and the initiative to create encounters between different ethnic and religious worlds at the YMCA.\nNature and the city \u2013 In recent years there have been vocal calls for reintroducing nature into the city and providing more opportunities for crossover from the urban grind to a more pastoral, natural atmosphere. Making nature more accessible creates urban nature spots that attract diverse populations who come to enjoy these spaces alongside one another. For animals, urban nature spots offer an oasis of food and living space within the paved and built-up area of the city.\nAlong the tracks: A railway tour of Jerusalem\u2019s complexities \u2013 People in Jerusalem are all on a spectrum between the holy and the everyday, between ancient and new, spiritual and political, personal and national, religious and secular, Jewish and Arab, East and West. These spectrums are crisscrossed by the city\u2019s light rail system, which connects the southwestern and northeastern edges of the city. On the one hand, the trolley system has united Jerusalem; on the other hand, while traveling on the light rail, these connections sometimes appear to be loose to the point of being nonexistent. The points of contact between different worlds that are interwoven along the light rail\u2019s route provide a fascinating look at the city\u2019s complexities.\nThe study day closed with a lecture from halakhic scholar Malka Puterkovsky, a visiting faculty member at the Institute, who discussed the tensions and social seams in the story of the Jerusalem synagogue featured in the movie The Women\u2019s Balcony (2016). Malka\u2019s presentation served as a springboard for a discussion about what unites groups with different worldviews.\nThe fellows found the encounters with participants from the other programs of the Institute to be extremely important. The tours and discussions enabled them to talk about issues of leadership in areas of conflict from very different perspectives, allowing them to expand their perspectives and, as they described it, to \u201cilluminate their blind spots.\u201d Moreover, the discussions gave rise to new connections and possibilities for creating partnerships that will help fellows deal with similar challenges in different areas of activity.\n","html_content":"<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/joint-day-0421.jpg\" alt=\"Joint study day, April 2021\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<p>The Mandel Leadership Institute\u2019s joint study days offer fellows of all the Institute\u2019s programs an important opportunity to meet, talk, and get to know one another, and are designed to expose fellows to the full range of content and spheres of influence in which the Institute is active.<\/p>\n<p>The joint study days create an innovative and challenging environment for leadership development, which facilitates engagement with important ideas and encourages the creation of enriching connections.

Conducted online during Israel\u2019s third COVID-19 lockdown, the event was designed in a manner that practically applied the key values of the Institute and served as an encounter between talented people and big ideas.\nJoint study days offer an important opportunity for fellows of all the Institute\u2019s programs to get to know each other and exchange ideas. They also aim to expose the fellows to the full range of content and spheres of influence in which the Institute is active. \u201cWe look at the COVID-19 crisis in a sober and humble manner, and choose to make the most of the learning opportunities that it presents,\u201d said Yael Hess, director of the Mandel Leadership Institute, in her address to the participants. \u201cWe reinvent ourselves and constantly re-examine our value system. Being a leader requires dealing with difficulties that must be addressed, finding the right tools for dealing with them, and creating meaningful learning encounters that promote personal interaction, while not shying away from the difficulties,\u201d she added.\nThe fellows of the Mandel Leadership Institute's diverse leadership programs hail from different communities and sectors in Israeli society. They include leaders from the Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) community, leaders in non-formal education for youth, leaders in Jewish culture, and officers of the Israel Defense Forces. Joint study days provide a space in which all these fellows can come together to engage in constructive dialogue, and listen and respond, thereby broadening and improving the quality of discourse, strengthening and enhancing their leadership skills, and improving their ability to translate their ideas into action plans.\nThe social distancing requirements of the COVID-19 period demanded flexible and creative thinking on the part of the Institute, which redesigned the format of this event in response to the situation. A special online environment was developed to overcome the challenges of distance learning and the inability to meet face-to-face. The aim was to create a comfortable and aesthetic learning environment that would be easy for the fellows to navigate and that would facilitate their maximum involvement, while taking into account differences in their digital literacy and varied physical conditions during participation in the event. There was also a focus on the non-formal, interpersonal aspect, which was an important part of the event.\n\nThroughout the day, online learning sessions were held with senior faculty members of the various leadership programs, which enabled fellows to learn about issues and content of interest to them. One of the study units in the Mandel Programs for Leadership Development in the Haredi Community explored the tension when Israelis who live a religious, Torah-based lifestyle interact with general Israeli society, to which they also belong and in which they operate. \u201cThe fellows of our program represent vibrant and creative growth in the Haredi community,\u201d said Dr. Naomi Perl, the director of the program. \u201cThey are committed to precise, values-driven action, and operate as mediators between all these worlds.\u201d The program\u2019s fellows delve into the tensions between change and conservation, between the individual, the community, and the state, between self-actualization and fulfilling expected roles, and between tradition and modernity, as well as questions about the roles of community leaders (and of the fellows themselves) in the Haredi community in the current age.\nA conversation between Dr. Ruth Calderon and halakhic scholar Malka Puterkovsky, both faculty members of the Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture, focused on the works and ideas of the Hebrew poet Haim Nahman Bialik, in an attempt to define the significance of his work in today\u2019s Israeli culture. In addition to being Israel\u2019s national poet, Bialik was a philosopher, entrepreneur, and groundbreaking cultural leader. \u201cWe relate to contemporary realities through the lens of Bialik's words,\u201d said Dr. Ruth Calderon. \u201cWhile he was raised in the Hasidic world, as a creative artist he was careful to read and study the world around him. That wealth of knowledge helps create a culture that is rich, deep, and connected to its roots.\u201d In closing, Malka Puterkovsky noted that \u201cBialik understood the poetry of traditional Jewish sources, which contain all kinds of voices that can be combined into a single canonical voice while maintaining the differences between them.\u201d\n\nThe study day raised curiosity and interest, both on a personal and cultural level and on an intellectual level. Despite the fact that it was held online, the participants felt they had a real opportunity to meet and talk with one another, and enjoyed a meaningful interpersonal and cross-sectoral encounter that included social and emotional experiences alongside learning and study. \u201cI think that there is great importance in holding joint sessions with other Mandel leadership programs. It is enriching in terms of both content and human capital,\u201d wrote one of the fellows, while another added: \u201cThe interface between the fellows of the different programs is so fruitful\u2026 In this manner, we will be able to help each other deal with different and similar leadership challenges.\u201d\n","html_content":"<p> \n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/joint-2021-01.jpg\" alt=\"Thinking Anew: Interpersonal Encounters in Online Environments\" class=\"img-responsive\"> \n   <br> \n<\/p>\n<p>In January, the Mandel Leadership Institute held its first joint study day of the 2020-2021 academic year for the fellows of all its programs.

That wealth of knowledge helps create a culture that is rich, deep, and connected to its roots.\u201d In closing, Malka Puterkovsky noted that \u201cBialik understood the poetry of traditional Jewish sources, which contain all kinds of voices that can be combined into a single canonical voice while maintaining the differences between them.\u201d<br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<p> \n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/joint-2021-02.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Ruth Calderon and Malka Puterkovsky in conversation\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n      <span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Dr. Ruth Calderon and Malka Puterkovsky in conversation<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>The study day raised curiosity and interest, both on a personal and cultural level and on an intellectual level.

Who is a Jew? What should Jews do \u2013 or not do? Who should make decisions for the Jewish people? Competing answers to these questions have caused cities to divide, protests to erupt, and governments to fall.\nBut Jewish Israeli culture is also a powerful creative force, which in the 72 short years of the State of Israel\u2019s existence has created a unique set of holidays, rituals, institutions, and language. Despite societal and political rifts and challenges, Israeli Jewish culture is a vibrant scene \u2013 a renaissance of an ancient Jewish tradition interwoven with avant-garde modern innovations. The prominent place that Jewish art and music, television and film, and most recently cuisine now have on the scene of world culture is a testament to this vibrancy.\nCan the vibrancy and creativity of Jewish Israeli culture serve as a balm and connector to heal the societal rifts of Israeli and Jewish society? This is what the Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture seeks to do. It brings together 20 trailblazing cultural leaders and budding cultural innovators from across Israeli Jewish society and gives them the opportunity to deepen their knowledge, widen their perspectives and networks, professionalize their skills, and create a rich vision for their cultural leadership \u2013 and its role in improving Israeli society.\nWhat Jewish culture and identity will Israelis pass on to their children? For decades, Israel has been rocked by debates about what kind of Jewish culture should be included in the education of its younger generation. In the most recent iterations of this debate, some people are concerned about the increasing insertion of Jewish content into the curriculum of non-religious schools (which is called by some Israelis \u201creligification\u201d), while others bemoan the lack of Jewish literacy in Israeli schools.\nWhat kind of Jewish culture do we want to teach our children? At the Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture, we seek to enrich this debate by turning to moments in Jewish history when these questions arose: from Talmudic times, to 18th century Jewish enlightenment debates, to debates about Hebrew culture in the streets of young Tel Aviv. In the classroom of Cohort 3 of our program, the study of one such debate sparked the creation of a unique online publication called The Liberty to Choose, which explores Jewish culture from Jerusalem of 2020 to Tangiers of 1916 and back again, and includes essays by the faculty and fellows of the program.\nAmong the long-forgotten pages of the French newspaper La Libert\u00e9, published in Tangiers between 1915-1922, are the textual remains of a roiling debate on the nature of Jewish culture in Jewish Moroccan schools. Over a period of a year, the newspaper was rocked by op-eds advocating a universalist view of Judaism rather than a traditionalist view, and contrasting a holistic Jewish view combining old and new, with a more reformative approach. The articles were written by writers residing in Morocco, New York, Argentina, and Israel.\nThe essays were translated from the original French to Hebrew for the first time for a course taught by Mandel faculty member Dr. David Guedj as part of the Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture. The essays resonated deeply with the program\u2019s fellows, who appreciated the contemporary challenges found in these century-old essays, which were written in a respectful debate style and set in the unique setting of North African modernity interspersed with French culture and Jewish community life. The fellows were energized by the fact that similar debates that took place in Europe, the United States, and Israel were well known, while debates that had taken place in Muslim lands had mostly been forgotten. This inspired the group to re-engage with this debate, and add their own reflections to the conversation.\nAs a result, each Mandel Jewish Culture fellow wrote their own essay with their personal reflections on Jewish cultural education, in response to the La Libert\u00e9 debate. The program\u2019s faculty members \u2013 including Dr. Ruth Calderon, Dr. Jeremy Fogel, Malka Puterkovsky, program director Mishael Zion, and Mandel Leadership Institute director Yael Hess \u2013 as well as guest lecturers Professor David Banon and Professor Zohar Shavit, also joined the \"fray,\" creating a rich discourse on the question of what Jewish culture should be the focus of education of our children and of our \"public square.\"\nSince one of the goals of the Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture is to deepen the discourse of Jewish culture not only among the fellows but within Israeli society at large, the Hebrew translations of the original French essays were published alongside the new essays written by the fellows in an online edition available to Hebrew readers the world over. Nothing, perhaps, embodies \u201cJewish culture\u201d more than interpolating Jewish texts and bringing them into a relevant debate in contemporary communities. The Hebrew volume, which is available for download here, will be the focus of a special online event hosted by the Mandel Leadership Institute on January 7, 2021.\nAs Israel enters its eighth decade, its culture is increasingly being led by a generation whose grandparents immigrated to Israel, and who are now raising their own children and wondering: What story should Israel tell? This is a generation whose grandparents immigrated to Israel in the years before and after its founding, and who subsequently toiled to create the new Israeli state, society, and culture. While the second generation often sought to put aside its cultural heritage in order to blend in to the new Israeli society, which often demanded a denial of diaspora culture, the third generation is blazing a new path.\nComfortable in their \"Israeliness\" in a way the first and second generation immigrants weren\u2019t, the current generation of Israeli \u201cgrandchildren\u201d are reaching back to the stories, sounds, and tastes of their grandparents, in order to move forward and infuse Israeli society with the rich voices of forgotten diasporas, neglected cultures, and overlooked traditions. Whether they come from North Africa or the Middle East, Eastern Europe or Western Europe, or \u2013 as is often the case \u2013 from a mixture of these countries, these grandchildren are digging deep into their past in order to create a vibrant Israeli culture for future generations. At the same time, the children of immigrants who have come more recently from North America, the Former Soviet Union, and Ethiopia, have caught on fast, adopting this more multi-cultural vision of Israeli Judaism and becoming a part of it.\nAt the Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture, these questions have been a powerful issue for many of the fellows. Cohort 3, which ended its year of study in the Summer of 2020, included many cultural figures who explored their ancestors\u2019 culture both before and during their participation in the program in order to bring the sounds and movement of that culture into their lives, their work, and into modern day Israel:\nMusician Neta Elkayam, translated her special connection with her grandmother into a ground-breaking musical path which takes Judeo-Arabic texts and the rich tradition of Jewish Moroccan music and reproduces it, with a contemporary sound, on stages around the world. A 2019 documentary film about her work with her partner Amit Hai Cohen was produced by Morrocan Muslim documentarian Kamal Hachkar, and titled \u201cIn Your Eyes, I See My Country\u201d (watch the trailer here). As an example of the connections made during her year at Mandel, her most recent song, Jai Men Blado, combines a Jewish Russian folk tune with Judeo-Arabic words. With the help of her Mandel colleague Alexandra Mandelbaum, also a fellow in the program, she added a verse in Russian to the song.\nOrian Shukrun, the 27-year-old musical director and conductor of El Maghribia \u2013 the Andalusian Orchestra of Maalot Tarshiha, in Israel\u2019s Galilee, creates a unique blend of Western and Andalusian music that is reverberating across Israel.\nOnline-community manager Einat Levy uses social media to reconnect immigrants from Diasporic communities back to their geographical roots. Her most popular Facebook group, which connects descendants of the Jewish community of Fes in Morocco, is called The Jewish Fes-Book Project. She is also the force behind The Moroccan Jewish Story in 360, which offers virtual tours of Moroccan Jewish heritage sites via the Internet.\nOrly Portal, previously a BatSheva dancer and currently a nationally renowned choreographer, has created a unique dance language inspired by Moroccan dance and body language. Her approach has drawn dancers from around the world to study at her feet.\nThe graduates presented above are all examples of program participants who have delved into the culture of the once large Jewish community in Morocco. But that is just one example of the cultural creations of these Israeli \u201cgrandchildren.\u201d Other current fellows have had the cultural richness of their families from Thessaloniki, Moldova, Yemen, Persia, Tunisia, and New York inform their work. The richness of the Diasporic traditions of this third generation enriches the vibrancy of Jewish Israeli society, giving it new sounds, ideas, and tools to deal with the challenges of 21st century identity.\n","html_content":"<p><img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Liberty-news-1.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of The Liberty to Choose\" class=\"img-responsive\/>  <span class=\"><span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Cover of <\/span>\n<em class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">The Liberty to Choose<\/em><span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">, an&nbsp;anthology with essays by the faculty and graduates of the program<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Jewish culture is the focal point of myriad debates and polemics, politics and disagreements in Israel.

In Israel, more than a million people lost their jobs and the economy stalled. Life everywhere has been characterized by enormous uncertainty and fear with regard to every area of life. This has been a unique crisis, very different from anything we have encountered before.\nFrom the moment that the Israeli government began imposing restrictions on civilian movement and activity, through the point at which a full lockdown was imposed, all public systems in the country were forced to reorganize themselves in a very short period of time and had to find new and creative ways to remain relevant, productive, and meaningful.\nBecause the education system shut down completely, including non-formal education settings, Israel\u2019s children and youth were consigned to educational and social isolation. They found themselves at home, with their families, lacking any significant external educational activity, removed from their friends and from other meaningful adult figures who could support them.\nQuickly, and with great initiative and creativity, non-formal education professionals found ways to develop and maintain meaningful ongoing connections with young people, both those affiliated with their organizations and those who were not.\nUnder the auspices of the Mandel Leadership Institute, the Mandel Youth Leadership Program decided to study this phenomenon as it was occurring. It documented a moment at which a new form of pedagogy was emerging, at which \u2013 against all odds \u2013 exciting new educational initiatives were being created; a moment at which identity, commitment, and longing for connection overcame the barriers of isolation and distance, and continued to drive the wheels of education.\nThe findings of this review were published in a report that is not an academic study; rather, it is a form of documentation, an attempt to capture the moment, to listen to many voices, and to produce a single, up-to-the-minute description of what happened in non-formal education during the first lockdown in Israel in real time.\nThe review was thus written as the events transpired. Its goal was to\u00a0map and catalogue responses in non-formal education using online tools, in conditions of considerable uncertainty, and involving rapid appraisal in real time of activities being carried out in the field. It surveys the character and scale of these activities, their effectiveness, the lessons learned from them, and the infrastructure they require, and includes thoughts about the future.\nThe survey is intended to provide a basis for future implementation during crises, and thus to serve as a useful tool for education institutions, offer basic premises for future research into new methods, pedagogies, and approaches to educational practice, and provide an examination of the effects and outcomes of this strange and unique period of forced social isolation.\nThe review was initiated by Yael Hess, director of the Mandel Leadership Institute, and Miki Nevo, then the director of the Mandel Youth Leadership\u00a0Program and today the director of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North.

One of the program's main goals this year is to create an active and entrepreneurial network of its fellows and graduates, which will drive trans-sectorial innovations and collaborations in Israeli society. On Monday, February 24, a day-long event for the first three cohorts of the program launched this network. This event brought together professionals engaged in the arts, community work, education, and the media, who hail from a variety of social sectors and are all involved in promoting Jewish culture in Israeli society and in strengthening and enriching Jewish life in Israel.\nThe event began with a presentation by Yael Hess, director of the Mandel Leadership Institute, in which she reviewed recent changes and innovations at the Institute and the expansion of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel's work with graduates.\nMishael Zion, director of the Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture, stressed the importance of fostering connections in an age of division and introversion. \u201cCulture is created by encounters between different groups,\" he said. \"Creativity and innovation are born by importing ideas and realities from one space to another. This graduate network provides a unique opportunity for exchanging ideas, for sharing different perspectives on how to read our realities, and for forging links that transcend boundaries between professional and theoretical areas.\u201d\nThis desire to create new connections and to create a network of cultural leaders found expression in an exercise called \u201cClosing the Triangle,\u201d in which the network members were asked to identify two people in the group who do not know one another, but who would enrich Israeli culture if they were to meet, and to introduce them. The room was immediately transformed into a bustling culture factory, swelling with the sounds of encounters between different people, professions, fields, and identities, of dialogues forming, and of the intricate weave of culture being woven stronger and stronger.\nAfter their discussions in groups of three, the participants moved into four professional circles facilitated by fellows and graduates of the program, and discussed the challenges and opportunities offered by different areas of the field of Jewish culture in Israel. The professional groups focused on the following:\nWomen\u2019s singing and religious sensitivities: Proposals for a solution \u2013 This group was headed by Livnat Ben-Hamou, senior broadcaster at the IDF's Galgalatz radio station; Chen Artzi Sror, a journalist for Yediot Aharonot; and Omer Ben Rubi, an editor and broadcaster for the Kan radio station. It discussed different possibilities for solving the issue of women\u2019s marginalization in Israeli society. The discussion in this group linked halakhic discourse with questions of feminism, as related to the extent to which women are heard in the media in Israel.\nIsraeli and Jewish art: A current picture \u2013 This circle was led by Ronen Izhaki, director of Between Heaven and Earth, a non-profit organization devoted to dance; Leor Grady, a multidisciplinary artist who lectures at the Minshar School of Art; and Porat Salomon, artist and founder of the Pardes School of Art. It discussed \"Jewish art,\" and focused on the nexus between the two components of this concept. A lively debate about the link between \"Jewish\" and \"art\" centered on a discussion about the body in Judaism, as well as its representations, characteristics, and implications.\nLeadership in culture and art: Management, growth, and development \u2013 This group was led by Rachel Keshet, founder of Rachel Keshet Theater; Rachel Gets Salomon of Ha\u2019aretz, and Orly Portal, dance artist and founder of the Orly Portal Dance Troupe. It focused on issues related to artistic direction. We are all familiar with the challenge of the work-life balance, but artists have an additional tension at the heart of their work: the balance between creativity and management. The members of this group discussed ways to manage professional relationships on the axis of artist and artistic director.\nJewish renewal and community renewal \u2013 This circle was led by Heli Bareket Tabibi, one of the leaders of Rashut Ha\u2019Rabim \u2013 The Jerusalem Forum of Jewish Renaissance Organizations; Mor Shimonie, alumni coordinator for BINA: The Jewish Movement for Social Change; and Oded Mazor, rabbi of Kehilat Kol HaNeshama in Jerusalem. It explored issues related to \u201ccommunity\" and \"community activity.\u201d The members of this group each spoke about the initiatives that they head and the challenges that they face in the field. The group discussed the similarities and differences found in the management of different kinds of communities \u2013 virtual, real-world, synagogues, and others.\nThe event closed with an up-to-the-minute cultural event: a pre-release screening of Keren Yedaya\u2019s new movie Red Fields, a cinematic adaptation of the Israeli rock opera Mami, which was followed by a discussion. Three members of the network who are involved in cinema shared their perspectives, triggering a lively debate of ethnic, class, and social issues that characterize work in the realm of culture in Israel, and of the very different approaches taken by the fellows and graduates who make up the network.\nThroughout the day, the various discussions and circles repeatedly raised one of the main questions asked at the Mandel Leadership Institute: \u201cWhat is going on in the field? What is considered state of the art in Israel and around the world?\u201d This gathering of members of the Jewish culture network, who are themselves leaders and entrepreneurs in a wide and diverse range of fields, facilitated the creation of a broad and up-to-date picture of Jewish and Israeli culture, and sparked thoughts about new possibilities.\n","html_content":"<p>\u200bThe Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture is currently in its third year of operation. One of the program's main goals this year is to create an active and entrepreneurial network of its fellows and graduates, which will drive trans-sectorial innovations and collaborations in Israeli society. On Monday, February 24, a day-long event for the first three cohorts of the program launched this network. This event brought together professionals engaged in the arts, community work, education, and the media, who hail from a variety of social sectors and are all involved in promoting Jewish culture in Israeli society and in strengthening and enriching Jewish life in Israel.<\/p>\n<p>The event began with a presentation by \n   <strong>Yael Hess<\/strong>, director of the Mandel Leadership Institute, in which she reviewed recent changes and innovations at the Institute and the expansion of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel's work with graduates.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <strong><img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/JCulture-Network-2020-1.jpg\" alt=\"From a New Program to an Influential Network\" class=\"img-responsive\"><br><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Mishael Zion<\/strong>, director of the Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture, stressed the importance of fostering connections in an age of division and introversion. \u201cCulture is created by encounters between different groups,\" he said. \"Creativity and innovation are born by importing ideas and realities from one space to another. This graduate network provides a unique opportunity for exchanging ideas, for sharing different perspectives on how to read our realities, and for forging links that transcend boundaries between professional and theoretical areas.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This desire to create new connections and to create a network of cultural leaders found expression in an exercise called \u201cClosing the Triangle,\u201d in which the network members were asked to identify two people in the group who do not know one another, but who would enrich Israeli culture if they were to meet, and to introduce them. The room was immediately transformed into a bustling culture factory, swelling with the sounds of encounters between different people, professions, fields, and identities, of dialogues forming, and of the intricate weave of culture being woven stronger and stronger.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/JCulture-Network-2020-2.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt><br><\/p>\n<p>After their discussions in groups of three, the participants moved into four professional circles facilitated by fellows and graduates of the program, and discussed the challenges and opportunities offered by different areas of the field of Jewish culture in Israel.

Nigel is someone who knows how to ask big questions and believes that they can be answered creatively, no matter how large the challenge. We have asked him to sum up his 20 years of activism on climate change in the Jewish community, and to share with us insights from this act of leadership.\u201d\n\nIn his lecture, Nigel Savage \u2014 a prominent figure in climate change discourse in the international Jewish community \u2014 presented the goal of his nonprofit organization: \u201cHazon seeks to improve environmental quality in the world as a whole by changing the discourse within the Jewish community,\u201d he said. Savage surveyed the unique challenges involved in changing practices and discourse with regard to the climate crisis: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for us to cope with global warming because as people, we need a clear definition of success and failure, and because we want to feel we are on the side of good as opposed to other, 'bad' forces. On this issue, however, there are no good guys and no bad guys. We have all grown up in a way that is simply not sustainable.\u201d\n\u201cI want to focus on an act of leadership that each of us can perform, beyond examining our personal consumption and habits. Not just on the things that every state can do, but on leveraging the power that we have over intermediate organizations,\u201d Savage said. He emphasized that \u201csignificant change can come via the impact of individuals on the organizations and communities of which they are members. It is easier to change organizations and communities than it is to change governments because they are smaller, but these organizations also have influential power that can affect government policy. Setting up organizational \u2018green teams\u2019 is critical for achieving meaningful change.\u201d\nSavage also highlighted our dietary habits as a lever for change. \u201cThroughout most of human history, people ate meat and milk, but never on the industrial scale and daily basis seen today. The most effective, convenient, and significant way to ease the burden on the climate is to reduce our consumption of these products, not only on the level of the family but also on a communal and organizational level\u201d he said. \u201cThe Jewish community is blessed with a number of central institutions that have always been essential to it; now, we can change the consumption patterns of these Jewish institutions, and thus of the Jewish people and, ultimately, the entire world.\u201d\nIn conclusion, Savage quoted Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the former chief rabbi of Britain: \u201cOptimism is the belief that the world is changing for the better. Hope is the belief that we can change it for the better.\u201d\n","html_content":"<p>\n   <strong>\u200bNigel Savage<\/strong>, the founder and director of Hazon: The Jewish Lab for Sustainability, explored the power of Jewish identity and the Jewish community to respond to the prospect of climate crisis, in a lecture hosted by the Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJewish history is full of creative responses to the most desperate crises, from Noah and the Flood through to the 20th century,\" said \n   <strong>Mishael Zion<\/strong>, the director of the Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture, in his introduction to the lecture, held on May 26 at the Mandel Leadership Institute. \"When it comes to the climate crisis, our program asks: How can we use Jewish culture as a resource to cope with the challenges and crises that are now at our door?

Savage surveyed the unique challenges involved in changing practices and discourse with regard to the climate crisis: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for us to cope with global warming because as people, we need a clear definition of success and failure, and because we want to feel we are on the side of good as opposed to other, 'bad' forces. On this issue, however, there are no good guys and no bad guys. We have all grown up in a way that is simply not sustainable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI want to focus on an act of leadership that each of us can perform, beyond examining our personal consumption and habits. Not just on the things that every state can do, but on leveraging the power that we have over intermediate organizations,\u201d Savage said. He emphasized that \u201csignificant change can come via the impact of individuals on the organizations and communities of which they are members. It is easier to change organizations and communities than it is to change governments because they are smaller, but these organizations also have influential power that can affect government policy. Setting up organizational \u2018green teams\u2019 is critical for achieving meaningful change.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Savage also highlighted our dietary habits as a lever for change. \u201cThroughout most of human history, people ate meat and milk, but never on the industrial scale and daily basis seen today. The most effective, convenient, and significant way to ease the burden on the climate is to reduce our consumption of these products, not only on the level of the family but also on a communal and organizational level\u201d he said. \u201cThe Jewish community is blessed with a number of central institutions that have always been essential to it; now, we can change the consumption patterns of these Jewish institutions, and thus of the Jewish people and, ultimately, the entire world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, Savage quoted Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the former chief rabbi of Britain: \u201cOptimism is the belief that the world is changing for the better. Hope is the belief that we can change it for the better.\u201d<br><\/p>\n","images":{"nigel-savage.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/institute.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Nigel-Savage.jpg","caption":""}},"attachments":[],"outer_links":[]},"shmita-conference-2019":{"title":"Symposium: Looking Toward Israel\u2019s Shmita Year","date":"2019-05-26","image":"https:\/\/institute.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Shmita-Conference_s.jpg","excerpt":"The Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture hosted an event on the significance of the sabbatical year in the Israeli and Jewish space\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/institute.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Shmita-conference-2019.aspx","is_inner":"yes","slug":"shmita-conference-2019","text":"\u200bAs Israel begins to approach the upcoming Shmita (\"sabbatical\") year in 5782 (2021\u20132022), the Mandel Leadership Institute hosted a symposium on the role of the sabbatical year, in which agricultural land is to remain fallow, in Jewish and Israeli culture.\u00a0\nThe symposium was coordinated by Mishael Zion, director of the Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture, and was led by Nigel Savage, president of the US-based organization Hazon: The Jewish Lab for Sustainability; Rabbi Michael Melchior, the former minister for environmental protection and former minister for diaspora affairs, and current (among other positions) president of the nonprofit organization Teva Ivri (Jewish Nature); Einat Kramer, the executive director of Teva Ivri; and Aharon Ariel Lavi of Hazon.\n\u201cDreaming big dreams and engaging in long-term planning are two of the central features of the leadership model that we promote at the Mandel Leadership Institute,\u201d said program director Mishael Zion in his opening address. \u201cWe see the Shmita year as an opportunity to advance a range of activities in Israeli society based on a broad vision for Jewish culture,\" he continued. \"The Shmita year is the Jewish people\u2019s sabbatical year, offering an opportunity for a new form of dialogue on issues such as solidarity, education, environment, social equality, economics, and our relationship with our land and with the earth.\u201d\nRabbi Michael Melchior noted that \u201cin the past, public engagement with the Shmita year focused only on the challenges posed by the agricultural restrictions in Jewish law, and this only affected very limited population groups.

This was driven by initiatives led by organizations such as Teva Ivri, Pa\u2019amonim, and many others (among other factors).\u201d\nEinat Kramer provided an overview of activities that had been carried out during the previous Shmita year, and presented the vision of Teva Ivri for 2021\u20132022. \u201cThe upcoming Shmita year will be a major year of discussion and action on social, environmental, and economic issues in Israel at a national level, with government resources to be allocated via a state Shmita commission.

The cohort included representatives from all parts of this sector \u2013 leaders in youth movements, leaders in youth organizations, and directors and coordinators of municipal youth divisions.<\/p>\n<p>The Mandel Program for Youth Leadership is a one-year program that provides, among other things, a framework for discussing the challenges facing Israeli society and the ability of the informal education sector to help address them. Similarly, the program aims to help the participants hone their educational identities, deepen their theoretical and practical knowledge, improve their familiarity with Israel\u2019s social and educational realities, and develop their ability to implement their educational ideas.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/youth3-finish.jpg\" alt=\"Cohort 3 of the Mandel Program for Youth Leadership\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n","images":{"youth3-finish.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/institute.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/youth3-finish.jpg","caption":""}},"attachments":[],"outer_links":[]},"mission-driven_s":{"title":"Pioneering Reborn: Mission-Driven Communities in Israel","date":"2018-03-12","image":"https:\/\/institute.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Mission-Driven_s.jpg","excerpt":"This Mandel Platform event explored the goals, ideological characteristics, and influence of mission-driven communities in Israel\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/institute.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/Resources\/BimatMandel\/EduAndCom\/Pages\/Pioneering-Reborn-Mission-Driven-Communities-in-Israel.aspx","is_inner":"no","slug":"mission-driven_s"},"jewish-culture-opening2017s":{"title":"Registration Opens for Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture","date":"2017-03-14","image":"https:\/\/institute.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Jewish-Culture-Opening2017s.jpg","excerpt":"The program aims to contribute to the vitality and diversity of Jewish culture in Israel by investing in leaders in education, culture, and community\u200b\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/institute.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/Programs\/Pages\/Mandel-Program-for-Leadership-in-Jewish-Culture.aspx","is_inner":"no","slug":"jewish-culture-opening2017s"},"haredi-registration-women-2018":{"title":"Registration Opens for Haredi Women's Leadership Program","date":"2018-01-31","image":"https:\/\/institute.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Haredi-Registration-2018s.jpg","excerpt":"The aim of the program is to develop and train educational and social leadership for the Haredi community\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/institute.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Haredi-Registration-Women-2018.aspx","is_inner":"yes","slug":"haredi-registration-women-2018","text":"2.\u00a0Leadership\n","html_content":"<p>\n      <strong>2.&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Leadership<\/strong><\/p>\n","images":[],"attachments":[],"outer_links":[]},"mizrahi-elites_s":{"title":"The Rise of New Elites \u2013 Mizrahi Israelis as a Case Study","date":"2017-12-11","image":"https:\/\/institute.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Mizrahi-elites_s.jpg","excerpt":"A Mandel Platform (Bimat Mandel) event featuring director and screenwriter David Deri and journalist Dr. Avishay Ben Haim\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/institute.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/Resources\/BimatMandel\/EcoAndCom\/Pages\/Mizrahi-elites.aspx","is_inner":"no","slug":"mizrahi-elites_s"},"graduation-2017":{"title":"Mandel Leadership Institute Celebrates Graduation","date":"2017-10-30","image":"https:\/\/institute.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Graduation-2017-1s.jpg","excerpt":"Fellows mark graduation in the presence of Mr. Morton Mandel, the IDF Chief Education Officer, and a representative of the Education Ministry\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/institute.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Graduation-2017.aspx","is_inner":"yes","slug":"graduation-2017","text":"\u200bOn October 30, 2017, the Mandel Leadership Institute celebrated the graduation of its programs in a festive ceremony held in the presence of Mr. Morton Mandel, chairman and CEO of the Mandel Foundation;

In the men's program, are ten fellows who are involved in education and the media and are leading major social welfare organizations. During this, their second year in the program, the ten fellows will work on developing their individual projects and translating their visions into reality.\nThe programs\u2019 basic assumption is that the task of confronting the challenges facing the Haredi community is the responsibility of the Haredi community and that communal leadership should emerge from within, from people who share the community's values and experiences.\nThe programs share the same principles as all Mandel Leadership Institute programs: an in-depth clarification of the social-educational vision; formulating it in a rich and precise manner; and translating it into action. The Mandel Leadership Institute\u2019s programs for leadership in the Haredi community are part of its broader vision \u2013 nurturing and empowering intelligent, open, and values-oriented leadership that is committed to the future of Israel as a thriving multicultural society, built on mutual responsibility, tolerance and recognition of the unique value and richness Israel's cultural ecology.\nAt the evening to mark the opening of the women's program on October 23, Moshe Vigdor, the director general of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel, discussed the Foundation's areas of activity in Israel.

Caspi is the founder of the Psychology in Judaism Institute and author of the bestselling Inquiring of God.\nDr. Daniel Marom, the head of pedagogical and tutorial development at the Mandel Leadership Institute, said in his remarks: \u201cThrough this book, Yair allows us to move on from individual longings to the communal-societal level by means of education, starting from the group of people who deal with the \u2018I\u2019 and proceeding towards the community and society that can work to heal the \u2018we.\u2019 In this way, inspired by his approach, we can fill the void in the Israeli-Jewish law that seeks God while discarding its idols.\u201d\nIn his lecture, \u201cThe Psychology of the Jews\u2019 Books,\u201d Dr. Caspi spoke of the source of the vision and the genesis of human creative artistry. According to Caspi, it was when human beings began to see the world as having been created that they gained the ability to join in the process of creation.\nThere were four respondents: Rani Bleier, playwright, television creator, and drama teacher, spoke of his journey between the secular world and \u201cinquiring of God\u201d in the wake of his discovery of the works of Maimonides. Bleier read a section from Caspi\u2019s earlier book and told how Caspi\u2019s writing influences his own work for television.
