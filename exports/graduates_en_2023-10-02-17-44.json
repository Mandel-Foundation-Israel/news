It may be difficult for us to imagine today, but when the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel originally opened its Graduate Unit, there were no alumni associations in Israel that provided graduates with opportunities for continuing professional development. This step was indicative not only of a commitment to innovation, but also\u00a0of the great importance that the Mandel Foundation always attached to continuing support for graduates after they completed their leadership programs.\nThere are many differences between the new Mandel Graduate Unit and its previous incarnation. The most prominent difference is that today anyone who has completed a Mandel leadership training program receives services from the Graduate Unit, whereas in the past, the Unit focused solely on graduates of the Foundation\u2019s flagship program, the Mandel School for Educational Leadership. The Foundation made this strategic change as an expression of its desire to broaden and deepen the impact of its graduates on Israeli society. That is, the change is rooted in the idea that leadership programs are an important and necessary first step, but are not sufficient on their own.\nThis decision, of course, affects our approach to our work. The mandate of the current Graduate Unit is to continue the professional and intellectual development of graduates, but unlike in the past, the orientation is toward the field. It is\u00a0important to us to support graduates in the practical changes they are leading in the real world, in all kinds of ways. Thus, alongside professional development, we are also involved in implementation support.\nThis is the source of another difference between the new Graduate Unit and its predecessor: our investment in community-building. We believe that the main strength of our graduates lies in their interconnectedness, in their ability to join forces and lead change together. For this reason, it is very important to us to create many opportunities for meaningful encounters between graduates, since these encounters have the potential to create fundamental, systemic, and sustainable change.\nOur ambition to create a vibrant and active community is also the reason why every Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel program or unit now has its own graduate community facilitator. The facilitators, as well as the faculty members of the programs, know their graduates personally, and are aware of their needs and of potential collaborations between them. No less important, they understand the specific field of action in which the graduates operate (for example, informal education for Bedouin society in the Negev) and are aware of the challenges they face. The work of the facilitators enables us to see the overall picture and to create relevant responses.\nHow does the Graduate Unit learn about the needs of the graduates?\nWe are constantly learning about our graduates and their needs. At the outset, we conducted in-depth interviews with over 150 graduates, who were quite\u00a0diverse. We learned a lot from them about how the Foundation is viewed, what their professional needs are, and what they would like to do together with other members of the graduate community. Around a year ago, we held several roundtable events that were attended by some 170 graduates. We presented to them our initial thoughts and ideas, as we worked to define the Unit\u2019s approach. That\u2019s where we really began to see the potential of connections between graduates.\nI think that the most significant learning about our graduates happens informally, in the course of our regular work. The new Unit began working with graduates in January 2022. Since then, we have met with over 1,000 graduates in various learning processes and activities that we hosted. We are getting to know the people behind the names, speaking with them, and listening to them in our day-to-day interactions with them. Here, too, the community facilitators play a key role in giving the graduates a voice. Recently, we also opened a Facebook group for graduates. This too is an important channel for listening to our graduates and learning about them.\nHow is it possible to create an effective network for so many graduates from such diverse programs?\nThat\u2019s a good question.\u00a0Because our community is very large and very heterogeneous, we have to be smart about this. We are learning and improving our approach and methods all the time. Currently, we have several strategies. We recently launched our \u201cprofessional network\u201d \u2013 an internal database that graduates can use to find one another. It already has information about almost 1,200 graduates, and graduates can search by name, areas of interest, fields of expertise, and other parameters.\nWe also have diversity in our activities. Except for cases in which there is professional value to having a common background, our preference is to create heterogeneous groups of graduates from different programs and different backgrounds. In the activities that we ran so far this year, the enormous value of bringing together people who do not know one another but share similar experiences as Mandel graduates was evident. The participants quickly overcame their differences and discovered that they speak a common language. In this sense, networking happens naturally.\nIn the coming months, we will also be launching an online magazine called \u201cThe Mandelist,\u201d which will provide a platform where our graduates can showcase their initiatives. This will provide more opportunities for members of the graduate community to get to know each other.\nWhat kinds of support and activities do you offer?\nThe Unit\u2019s leadership development approach has four main components:\nProfessionalization in leading changeContinuing intellectual developmentImplementation supportCommunity-building\nWe offer different activities and processes that further the goals of these components in different ways. For example, in the area of intellectual development, we held several one-day seminars over the last year that addressed issues of society and education, such as privacy in the public sphere or the issue of hatred. There have also been a number of processes led by Mandel faculty members, who each focused on their area of expertise. In the area of professionalization in leading change, we offered two types of activities: processes that focused on in-depth learning and training in theories of leading change (such as adaptive leadership and\u00a0resistance to change); as well as\u00a0processes that focused on developing specific skills (such as data-based management, or public speaking).\nIn the area of implementation support, we have taken a big step forward in formulating our methods and activities. We provide a framework and support to action groups of graduates who are passionate about leading change in a specific area. Since the new unit started operating, graduates formed several action groups in order to address issues that are high on the public agenda, such as reducing violence in Arab society or improving employment conditions for teaching staff. The groups are the purest expression of our leadership development approach, as graduates come together independently to lead change in areas that are sometimes part of their everyday work and are sometimes issues that they simply feel compelled to address.\nAnother type of implementation support can be found in the accelerator for educational-social entrepreneurship that we established this year, which encourages graduates to develop their ideas into real-world action. This is a very intensive program. Those who devote themselves to it receive a package of professional support that gets their initiative to the stage where it is ready to be launched.\nWhich graduate activity do you think was particularly important or successful?\nI think the most important activities have been activities that were initiated by graduates themselves, not necessarily activities initiated by the Unit. There were several such activities this year, and I consider them to be our most important contribution. For example, a group of Haredi graduates came together to think about making the field of mental health more accessible in the ultra-Orthodox community. Another important example was a group of Arab graduates in Baqa al-Gharbiyye who came together at the initiative of one of our graduates to study the government\u2019s five-year plan for Arab society in depth and to explore ways of making optimal use of the resources included in it.\nWe are very much at the beginning of our journey and are still taking our first steps. It is no exaggeration to say that we are learning something new every day. There have been times when we have changed or redefined planned activities, or we decided that they were not fully developed and went back to the drawing board. We still have much to learn about our graduates, and in particular about the best ways to work with them.\nLooking toward the future, within two or three years we hope to reach a stage in which a significant portion of our activity is driven by \u201cbottom-up\u201d processes, alongside the opportunities for professional and personal development that we will continue to offer. That is, we hope that our work will be driven by initiatives of graduates who are dissatisfied with things as they are, and see the Mandel Graduate Unit as a laboratory and professional space where they can develop, explore, and lead changes in society, together with partners from within the community. This is the part that I find most exciting \u2013 seeing where this process will take us.\n","html_content":"<img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/newMGU-8-2022-7.jpg\" alt=\"Maya Bozo Schwartz addresses Mandel graduates (Photo: Simanim)\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n<span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Maya Bozo Schwartz, director of the Mandel Graduate Unit, addresses Mandel graduates (Photo: Simanim)<br><br><br><\/span>\n<p>\n   <strong>Tell us about the new incarnation of the Mandel Graduate Unit.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The establishment of the original Mandel Graduate Unit was a groundbreaking step in the educational-social arena in Israel.

For this reason, it is very important to us to create many opportunities for meaningful encounters between graduates, since these encounters have the potential to create fundamental, systemic, and sustainable change.<\/p>\n<p>Our ambition to create a vibrant and active community is also the reason why every Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel program or unit now has its own graduate community facilitator. The facilitators, as well as the faculty members of the programs, know their graduates personally, and are aware of their needs and of potential collaborations between them. No less important, they understand the specific field of action in which the graduates operate (for example, informal education for Bedouin society in the Negev) and are aware of the challenges they face. The work of the facilitators enables us to see the overall picture and to create relevant responses.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/newMGU-8-2022-3.jpg\" alt=\"Graduates in the lobby of the Mandel Foundation building in Jerusalem (Photo: Simanim)\" class=\"img-responsive\"> \n   <span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Graduates in the lobby of the Mandel Foundation building in Jerusalem (Photo: Simanim)<\/span> <\/p>\n<p>\n   <strong><br>How does the Graduate Unit learn about the needs of the graduates?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are constantly learning about our graduates and their needs. At the outset, we conducted in-depth interviews with over 150 graduates, who were quite&nbsp;diverse. We learned a lot from them about how the Foundation is viewed, what their professional needs are, and what they would like to do together with other members of the graduate community. Around a year ago, we held several roundtable events that were attended by some 170 graduates. We presented to them our initial thoughts and ideas, as we worked to define the Unit\u2019s approach. That\u2019s where we really began to see the potential of connections between graduates.<br><\/p>\n<p>I think that the most significant learning about our graduates happens informally, in the course of our regular work. The new Unit began working with graduates in January 2022. Since then, we have met with over 1,000 graduates in various learning processes and activities that we hosted. We are getting to know the people behind the names, speaking with them, and listening to them in our day-to-day interactions with them. Here, too, the community facilitators play a key role in giving the graduates a voice. Recently, we also opened a Facebook group for graduates. This too is an important channel for listening to our graduates and learning about them.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/newMGU-8-2022-5.jpg\" alt=\"Graduates on the patio of the Mandel Foundation headquarters (Photo: Simanim)\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Graduates on the patio of the Mandel Foundation headquarters (Photo: Simanim)<\/span> \n   <br> \n   <br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <strong>How is it possible to create an effective network for so many graduates from such diverse programs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a good question.&nbsp;Because our community is very large and very heterogeneous, we have to be smart about this. We are learning and improving our approach and methods all the time. Currently, we have several strategies. We recently launched our \u201cprofessional network\u201d \u2013 an internal database that graduates can use to find one another. It already has information about almost 1,200 graduates, and graduates can search by name, areas of interest, fields of expertise, and other parameters.<\/p>\n<p>We also have diversity in our activities. Except for cases in which there is professional value to having a common background, our preference is to create heterogeneous groups of graduates from different programs and different backgrounds. In the activities that we ran so far this year, the enormous value of bringing together people who do not know one another but share similar experiences as Mandel graduates was evident. The participants quickly overcame their differences and discovered that they speak a common language. In this sense, networking happens naturally.<\/p>\n<p>In the coming months, we will also be launching an online magazine called \u201cThe Mandelist,\u201d which will provide a platform where our graduates can showcase their initiatives. This will provide more opportunities for members of the graduate community to get to know each other.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/newMGU-8-2022-2.jpg\" alt=\"A discussion between graduates (Photo: Mandel Foundation-Israel)\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">A discussion between graduates in the Negev (Photo: Mandel Foundation-Israel)<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n   <strong><br>What kinds of support and activities do you offer?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Unit\u2019s leadership development approach has four main components:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Professionalization in leading change<\/li><li>Continuing intellectual development<\/li><li>Implementation support<\/li><li>Community-building <\/li><\/ul>\n<p>We offer different activities and processes that further the goals of these components in different ways. For example, in the area of intellectual development, we held several one-day seminars over the last year that addressed issues of society and education, such as privacy in the public sphere or the issue of hatred. There have also been a number of processes led by Mandel faculty members, who each focused on their area of expertise. In the area of professionalization in leading change, we offered two types of activities: processes that focused on in-depth learning and training in theories of leading change (such as adaptive leadership and&nbsp;resistance to change); as well as&nbsp;processes that focused on developing specific skills (such as data-based management, or public speaking).<\/p>\n<p>In the area of implementation support, we have taken a big step forward in formulating our methods and activities. We provide a framework and support to action groups of graduates who are passionate about leading change in a specific area. Since the new unit started operating, graduates formed several action groups in order to address issues that are high on the public agenda, such as reducing violence in Arab society or improving employment conditions for teaching staff. The groups are the purest expression of our leadership development approach, as graduates come together independently to lead change in areas that are sometimes part of their everyday work and are sometimes issues that they simply feel compelled to address.<\/p>\n<p>Another type of implementation support can be found in the accelerator for educational-social entrepreneurship that we established this year, which encourages graduates to develop their ideas into real-world action. This is a very intensive program. Those who devote themselves to it receive a package of professional support that gets their initiative to the stage where it is ready to be launched.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/summer-meetings-4.jpg\" alt=\"A discussion between graduates (Photo: Simanim)\" class=\"img-responsive\"><span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Graduates at a roundtable event (Photo: Simanim)<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <strong><br>Which graduate activity do you think was particularly important or successful?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think the most important activities have been activities that were initiated by graduates themselves, not necessarily activities initiated by the Unit. There were several such activities this year, and I consider them to be our most important contribution. For example, a group of Haredi graduates came together to think about making the field of mental health more accessible in the ultra-Orthodox community. Another important example was a group of Arab graduates in Baqa al-Gharbiyye who came together at the initiative of one of our graduates to study the government\u2019s five-year plan for Arab society in depth and to explore ways of making optimal use of the resources included in it.<\/p>\n<p>We are very much at the beginning of our journey and are still taking our first steps. It is no exaggeration to say that we are learning something new every day. There have been times when we have changed or redefined planned activities, or we decided that they were not fully developed and went back to the drawing board. We still have much to learn about our graduates, and in particular about the best ways to work with them.<\/p>\n<p>Looking toward the future, within two or three years we hope to reach a stage in which a significant portion of our activity is driven by \u201cbottom-up\u201d processes, alongside the opportunities for professional and personal development that we will continue to offer. That is, we hope that our work will be driven by initiatives of graduates who are dissatisfied with things as they are, and see the Mandel Graduate Unit as a laboratory and professional space where they can develop, explore, and lead changes in society, together with partners from within the community. This is the part that I find most exciting \u2013 seeing where this process will take us.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/summer-meetings-2021.jpg\" alt=\"Mandel graduates around round tables (Photo: Simanim)\" class=\"img-responsive\"><span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Graduates at the Mandel Foundation headquarters in Jerusalem (Photo: Simanim)<\/span><br><\/p>\n","images":{"newmgu-8-2022-7.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/newMGU-8-2022-7.jpg","caption":""},"summer-meetings-2.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/summer-meetings-2.jpg","caption":"A graduate speaks at a roundtable\u00a0event (Photo: Simanim)"},"newmgu-8-2022-3.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/newMGU-8-2022-3.jpg","caption":"Graduates in the lobby of the Mandel Foundation building in Jerusalem (Photo: Simanim)"},"newmgu-8-2022-5.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/newMGU-8-2022-5.jpg","caption":"Graduates on the patio of the Mandel Foundation headquarters (Photo: Simanim)"},"newmgu-8-2022-2.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/newMGU-8-2022-2.jpg","caption":"A discussion between graduates in the Negev (Photo: Mandel Foundation-Israel)"},"summer-meetings-4.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/summer-meetings-4.jpg","caption":"Graduates at a roundtable event (Photo: Simanim)"},"summer-meetings-2021.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/summer-meetings-2021.jpg","caption":"Graduates at the Mandel Foundation headquarters in Jerusalem (Photo: Simanim)"}},"attachments":[],"outer_links":[]},"ukraine-grants-yael-shneider_s":{"title":"Mandel Foundation Grants Assist Refugees and Immigrants in Israel","date":"2022-07-28","image":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Ukraine-grants-Yael-Shneider_s.jpg","excerpt":"One million dollars was awarded to 39 Mandel graduates for initiatives supporting Ukrainian and Ethiopian refugees and new immigrants\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/_layouts\/Mandel13\/Internet\/RedirectTo.aspx?ID=MFI\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Mandel-refugee-and-immigrant-grants.aspx","is_inner":"no","slug":"ukraine-grants-yael-shneider_s"},"graduates-ukraine-2022":{"title":"Mandel Graduates Rise to Help Ukrainian Refugees","date":"2022-04-27","image":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/MGU-arik-2S.jpg","excerpt":"Mandel graduates helped refugees on the Polish border and in Kharkiv, rescued Holocaust survivors from Lviv, and provided food to refugees in Israel \u00a0","link":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Graduates-Ukraine-2022.aspx","is_inner":"yes","slug":"graduates-ukraine-2022","text":"Arik Mandelbaum: \u201cYou Can\u2019t Be an Uninvolved Bystander\u201d\nArik Mandelbaum, executive director of the Shiluv Center for psychotherapy and mindfulness training, is a graduate of Cohort 22 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership.

In 2017, he&nbsp;was awarded the \u201cComper Ambassadors Online\u201d award by the Elizabeth and Tony Comper Interdisciplinary Center for the Study of Antisemitism and Racism at the University of Haifa for his Israel advocacy and efforts to combat the delegitimization of Israel throughout the world.<\/p>\n<p>Minister of Culture and Sports Chili Tropper explained the committee\u2019s selection of Madi as torch lighter by citing his major contribution to fostering solidarity in Israeli society: \u201cMunir Madi is a prominent educator who has been involved for many years, first in his military service and later as a civilian, in providing equal opportunities for every person and connecting different sectors of society. Madi is a symbol of the significant bond formed between Druze society and Israeli society.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The ceremony will take place on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem on the eve of Israel Independence Day.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/munir-madi.jpg\" alt=\"Munir Madi (Courtesy)\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n","images":{"munir-madi.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/munir-madi.jpg","caption":""}},"attachments":[],"outer_links":[]},"mfi-graduation-2021s":{"title":"2021 Mandel Graduation Ceremony Held in Jerusalem","date":"2021-10-17","image":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/MFI-graduation-2021s.jpg","excerpt":"Graduates of all the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel\u2019s programs came together for a joint ceremony attended by President Isaac Herzog\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Graduation-2021.aspx","is_inner":"no","slug":"mfi-graduation-2021s"},"graduate-initiative-nigist-mengesha":{"title":"Ethiopian Youth: An \"Emergency Force\" in the Community","date":"2020-07-02","image":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/fidel-1s.jpg","excerpt":"An initiative by Dr. Nigist Mengesha, graduate of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership and director of the Fidel Association\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Graduate-Initiative-Nigist-Mengesha.aspx","is_inner":"yes","slug":"graduate-initiative-nigist-mengesha","text":"The Fidel Association was founded by Dr. Nigist Mengesha to advance the educational and social integration of Ethiopian-Israelis. Currently, Dr. Mengesha serves on the executive board of the Fidel Association and she is the director of the department of education, youth and sport in the municipality of Rosh HaAyin. She founded the Fidel Association not only to address the challenges of Ethiopian-Israelis, but also those of the society at large, with a view that social issues are shared by many different populations.\nFor over 14 years, Fidel (\"alphabet\" in Amharic) has operated youth centers for Ethiopian-Israelis in neighborhoods throughout Israel. These centers provide youth with a warm, supportive home for cultural and social enrichment, while encouraging them to take part in social activism. With the sudden coronavirus lockdown, however, the youth centers were forced to close. The youth now found themselves without their regular activities and without interactions with other teens and caring adults. At the same time, schools were shut down, making some youth more susceptible to dropping out of all frameworks.\nThe crisis plunged much of the Ethiopian community in Israel into desperate circumstances, as many already live below the poverty line and were now losing their jobs, either temporarily or permanently. Many in the community have a large number of children and live in small, crowded apartments, which can be a breeding ground for domestic violence. Daily survival became a major concern.\nAt the outset, Fidel's management staff drew up an emergency plan to ensure that the organization would be poised to meet the community\u2019s most pressing needs. As part of the plan, Dr. Mengesha, a graduate of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, initiated an inspiring project to recruit youth \u2013 primarily from Ashkelon, Lod, Ramla and Afula \u2013 to create an \u201cemergency force\u201d that would actively assist the community. The plan would ensure that the teens were meaningfully engaged and in regular contact with the center\u2019s staff, as well as helping to enhance their sense of personal value by feeling needed and connected. The Mandel Foundation gave their support for this emergency initiative to help the Ethiopian community weather this very difficult period.\nUnder the supervision of Fidel's staff, the youth were tasked with mapping the needs of people in their local community during the lockdown. Each young volunteer adopted two elderly members of the community and contacted them daily to gauge their immediate needs and to deliver food, medication and other essentials. The youth also went food shopping for single mothers who were unable to leave their children alone during the lockdown. In addition, the youth cooperated with the Lev Echad organization and harvested food from the fields of a local farmer to distribute to the needy.\nAnother objective of this initiative was to help raise the confidence that these young people have in their own capabilities, while enhancing the way they are viewed by others in the community.\nThe plan also included purchasing computers for those families who do not own one, so that the children could continue their school education remotely. It also provided online tutoring by mentors and youth center staff for those children experiencing language, educational or technological gaps.\nIn order to provide the community with critical information in Amharic about coping with the pandemic, Fidel also operated a hotline and the staff underwent special training with ERAN, a non-profit that provides emotional first aid by telephone and internet, so that they were prepared for all scenarios.\nOne illustration of the enormous impact that the Fidel\u00a0youth centers can have on Ethiopian youth is demonstrated through Natali's story:\nNatali\u00a0is a 17-year-old student from the ORT Lilienthal high school in Ramla. She attended a Purim program at the Fidel Ramla Youth Center: \"I was a bit apprehensive about coming to the center, because it's not in a good area of the city, but my friends convinced me that it would be worth it.\" Natali enjoyed herself so much that she decided to return, and soon made a strong connection with the center's manager, Nitzan Tafta, and her fellow teens.\u00a0\nNatali was well aware of the dangers that her fellow teens were regularly exposed to on the streets of Ramla and she began to take an interest in the community policing program. She developed a bond with Amir Adamso, an Ethiopian-Israeli active in the community policing unit, who taught her how to intervene effectively with youth at risk. Not surprisingly, during the crisis, she was the first to volunteer for the youth team that delivered food and essentials to needy families in the Weizman neighborhood of Ramla. Natali now plans to serve in the IDF Border Police upon finishing high school and to go on to university to study criminology.\nWith the recent relaxing of social distancing regulations, Fidel's youth centers have resumed their regular activities in accordance with the new guidelines. Personal protective equipment (PPE) was purchased and distributed to all seven youth centers in Israel. In early June, a professional development day for the youth center's staff and management enabled them to review the coronavirus emergency program, share learning experiences, and discuss the anticipated challenges after the long period of social distancing. A summer program is planned during which the ongoing health recommendations will be maintained. In the meantime, Fidel will continue to offer enrichment and direction to more than 600 youths between the ages of 13-18 in the cities of Beer Sheva, Ashkelon, Sderot, Petah Tikva, Ramla, Lod and Afula.\n\n\n\nAll photos and video courtesy of the Fidel Association.\n","html_content":"<p> \n   <a href=\"https:\/\/en.fidel.org.il\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Fidel Association<\/a> was founded by \n   <strong>Dr. Nigist Mengesha<\/strong> to advance the educational and social integration of Ethiopian-Israelis.

Many of these women are from underprivileged sectors of society, engaged in temporary or low-skilled jobs, making them the weakest link in the employment chain. The loss of their basic financial security has increased the likelihood of family crises, domestic violence and sexual abuse, as well as suicide attempts. There has already been an 18% increase in referrals to domestic violence crisis centers.\nFrom the start, Doris Mor, a graduate of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, quickly understood \u201cboth as a social worker and as a lawyer, that the employment crisis is never just a crisis for the individual being fired, but can also become a marital and family crisis. I knew that I would soon be hearing many painful stories of violence and possibly even murder.\u201d\nFor over 13 years, Doris has been running the Oganim (\"Anchors\") Institute, which provides occupational consulting and training to individuals to help them enhance their skills and professional standing. Due to the steep rise in unemployment during the recent crisis, Doris realized that it was critical to create a special program for disempowered women, particularly in light of the fact that as a result of economic necessity, over 60% of women return to their abusive husbands.\nDoris selected Jerusalem as the location for her new program, \u201cDo Not Walk Alone,\u201d as she knows the city well. She specifically wanted her activities to be situated in the Yovalim Community Association, which operates community centers in neighborhoods in the south-west of the city that service a population of around 25,000 and several enclaves of underprivileged families.\nIn preparation, Doris mapped out the neighborhoods and considered who might be suitable to join the program\u2019s steering committee. Gradually, she assembled a talented group of people that included directors of the community centers and social workers, as well as local and municipal administrators involved in professional training.\nDue to the urgent need that emerged during the crisis, Doris requested a grant from the Mandel Foundation to support the \u201cDo Not Walk Alone\u201d program, which targets unemployed women between the ages of 30-60, with\u00a0priority given to mothers of young children. The women meet for five 5-hour sessions in small groups, in accordance with current health regulations (in-person or via Zoom). The program provides these disadvantaged women with an immediate response tailored to their needs, enabling them to return to suitable, stable employment as soon as possible. By helping them to identify their strengths, improve their technological skills and expand their connections, the program enables these women to reinvent themselves professionally.\nDoris aims to motivate them and is inspired in return: \u201cI meet amazing women who know how to cook, bake, sew and knit. All these things have potential value in the marketplace.\u201d She shows these women that they have options: \u201cThey can even consider combining work as employees with life as small, independent freelancers.\u201d\nAfter steering committee meetings and a digital campaign advertising the program, the recruitment process is now underway for the next round of the program, after the completion of a first round during the Passover vacation. The idea is to recruit around 30 unemployed women, though Doris and the committee are aware that some will not complete the program.\nThe women who persist and complete the program will no longer be the same as they were before. They will discover their strengths, develop new skills, and gain a sense of hope for the future, as well as a new understanding that work is not just a means of survival, but also a key element in their identity. Work can provide them with vital independence and human dignity through their newfound economic and personal freedom.\nAs Doris Mor reveals, she went through her own occupational transformation: \u201cUntil I was 40, I had a wonderful career, working as a social worker. I set up the Maftechot (\u201cKeys\u201d) Hostel, the first of its kind in Israel to offer treatment to violent men. I also managed youth and welfare departments. Everything was going smoothly, until I suddenly had a mid-life crisis that triggered a self-discovery process, helping me to reach my true professional mission.\u201d Six months later, Doris set up the Oganim Institute and began to assist women and men to break through their employment crises by reinventing themselves professionally and returning to the workforce.\nDoris believes that we have entered a new era of work that poses extraordinary challenges. Many of us live longer and have many more years of retirement ahead of us. The coronavirus crisis has intensified everything. The world outside was closed, businesses collapsed and people were left anxious, depressed and in a state of uncertainty about the future. Her motto is that we must not abandon one another and that we do not need to walk alone.Photos: Shlomi Amsalem\n","html_content":"<p>The outbreak of coronavirus in Israel resulted in nearly one million people losing their jobs, 28% more women than men.

There, not only are students left without a highly personalized curriculum, but many have little to keep them occupied in the afternoons and evenings.\nSince 2012, Chinuch Ve\u2019Atid (Futures \u2013 Institute of Future Special Education) has been operating a network of educational and professional training institutions in the ultra-Orthodox educational system for students with learning disabilities, behavioral issues, emotional disorders, and communication disorders, as well as for at-risk youth, who often lack supportive families and often come from low socioeconomic backgrounds. The students in these institutions are aged 7\u201321. They are divided into specialized classes by age, and receive individualized educational programming according to their specific needs. The institutions are located throughout country, largely in areas that previously had not been well-served in this regard.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and the decision to shut down schools and to transition to remote learning left students in the special education system without the individual, age-appropriate curriculum that provides the scaffolding necessary for them to progress. This led to serious concern that if these students do not receive the tools and materials necessary to help them weather the coronavirus crisis, it would widen educational, emotional and social gaps. In addition, parents found themselves without professional tools and guidance for dealing with their children and for keeping them occupied during leisure time. This was particularly challenging because many of the students are at high risk of infection and were required to remain at home.\nTo mitigate the impact of the crisis in their institutions, Chinuch Ve\u2019Atid, founded by Elchanan Visenshteren, a graduate of the Mandel Program for Leadership Development in the Haredi Community, developed a plan for reducing these gaps during the ongoing emergency situation, and received support for this initiative from the Mandel Foundation. The organization quickly prepared materials to make it possible to continue studies with minimal interruption. An adapted curriculum for each student enabled lessons to pick up where they had left off. A booklet with information, educational content, work pages and coloring pages was distributed to each family, providing students with constructive activities for the spare time they now had. Learning and educational materials were made accessible to parents online and to students via email. A free advice hotline was set up and quickly became very busy. An additional telephone line played stories and other content, providing yet another solution for enriching free time. Books were also purchased and given to students in order to encourage reading and to motivate students to keep studying during this unusual period of time. Significant work on Chinuch Ve'Atid\u2019s website was also undertaken, to enable the students and their families to access a large and varied collection of material online.\nParents of students being serviced by the network shared some of their experiences during this very trying period and described how Chinuch Ve\u2019Atid schools have helped them and their children to cope:\nYossi (10) has behavioral and emotional disorders. In the words of his mother: \u201cWe would sit together, the whole family, and listen to the content on Chinuch Ve'Atid's special telephone line. Every day Revital, the school\u2019s guidance counselor, gave me tips for relaxation exercises. These enabled me to relax and calm both myself and Yossi during his outbursts, and we both managed to get through this period successfully. Thank you all!\u201dAvreimi (15) has an intellectual developmental disability. His father shared: \u201cThanks to the books we received for reading together with our children, I got to sit with my dear son and got to know him better, see his strengths and abilities, and discover his sense of humor, which I didn\u2019t really know about. We laughed together so much during these past months. Thank you for this wonderful initiative.\u201dChaya, a mother of a child with special needs, called the advice hotline to consult with the school\u2019s psychologist. She reported: \u201cMy son has significant motor problems and one evening I needed urgent advice about one of them. I called the hotline and received amazing advice and guidance! Throughout the period when we were at home, I worked with my son according to the guidance I received. When my son returned to school, I was told there was an improvement in his fine motor skills! I wouldn\u2019t have been able to make any progress with him if it weren\u2019t for the important advice I received.

This led to serious concern that if these students do not receive the tools and materials necessary to help them weather the coronavirus crisis, it would widen educational, emotional and social gaps. In addition, parents found themselves without professional tools and guidance for dealing with their children and for keeping them occupied during leisure time. This was particularly challenging because many of the students are at high risk of infection and were required to remain at home.<\/p>\n<p>To mitigate the impact of the crisis in their institutions, Chinuch Ve\u2019Atid, founded by \n   <strong>Elchanan Visenshteren<\/strong>, a graduate of the Mandel Program for Leadership Development in the Haredi Community, developed a plan for reducing these gaps during the ongoing emergency situation, and received support for this initiative from the Mandel Foundation. The organization quickly prepared materials to make it possible to continue studies with minimal interruption. An adapted curriculum for each student enabled lessons to pick up where they had left off. A booklet with information, educational content, work pages and coloring pages was distributed to each family, providing students with constructive activities for the spare time they now had. Learning and educational materials were made accessible to parents online and to students via email. A free advice hotline was set up and quickly became very busy. An additional telephone line played stories and other content, providing yet another solution for enriching free time. Books were also purchased and given to students in order to encourage reading and to motivate students to keep studying during this unusual period of time. Significant work on Chinuch Ve'Atid\u2019s website was also undertaken, to enable the students and their families to access a large and varied collection of material online.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Futures-2.jpg\" alt=\"Chinuch Ve\u2019Atid Futures \u2013 Institute of Future Special Education\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<p>Parents of students being serviced by the network shared some of their experiences during this very trying period and described how Chinuch Ve\u2019Atid schools have helped them and their children to cope:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Yossi (10) has behavioral and emotional disorders. In the words of his mother: \u201cWe would sit together, the whole family, and listen to the content on Chinuch Ve'Atid's special telephone line. Every day Revital, the school\u2019s guidance counselor, gave me tips for relaxation exercises. These enabled me to relax and calm both myself and Yossi during his outbursts, and we both managed to get through this period successfully. Thank you all!\u201d<br><br><\/li><li>Avreimi (15) has an intellectual developmental disability. His father shared: \u201cThanks to the books we received for reading together with our children, I got to sit with my dear son and got to know him better, see his strengths and abilities, and discover his sense of humor, which I didn\u2019t really know about. We laughed together so much during these past months. Thank you for this wonderful initiative.\u201d<br><br><\/li><li>Chaya, a mother of a child with special needs, called the advice hotline to consult with the school\u2019s psychologist. She reported: \u201cMy son has significant motor problems and one evening I needed urgent advice about one of them. I called the hotline and received amazing advice and guidance! Throughout the period when we were at home, I worked with my son according to the guidance I received. When my son returned to school, I was told there was an improvement in his fine motor skills! I wouldn\u2019t have been able to make any progress with him if it weren\u2019t for the important advice I received.

In 2019, the Dimona-Yeruham branch reached a new record in its activities in the region, distributing thousands of hot meals, giving out hundreds of vouchers for purchasing food, delivering hundreds of food baskets, hosting a large, public Passover Seder and organizing Birthright participants to volunteer on a weekly basis.\nWith the onset of the coronavirus crisis in Israel, almost all of Meir Panim's activities were suddenly halted, just when they were needed most. This was accompanied by a sudden drop in vital private donations made primarily by local residents, who were now fearful of the economic downturn.\nAt the same time, Meir Panim was aware of the increasing number of unemployed people, which rose nationally from 4% to 26% during the first weeks of the crisis. Unemployment benefits were also often slow to arrive.\nTo assist Meir Panim in resuming their charitable work as quickly as possible, the Mandel Foundation provided support that enabled Nisim to launch an initiative of recruiting about 15 disadvantaged youth from Dimona and Yeruham as volunteers to help the elderly members of the community. These local young people offered daily social and other essential support to the elderly, talking to them and taking care of their basic needs. This included delivering food and cooked meals to them, as well as assisting the few seniors who own smart phones to connect to the outside world remotely.\nIn exchange for their valuable help and once the situation allows, the youth will participate in a \"Chefs Workshop\" where they will receive professional training to become chef's assistants. Upon completing the workshop, the volunteers, none of whom have a high school diploma, will receive a certificate that is recognized by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, which will help them to integrate into the challenging employment market. The workshop will provide the youth with a sense of real accomplishment, as well as dignity and hope for the future.

The classes will be conducted on Thursdays, which will enable the participants to take the meals they have prepared home to their families to enjoy on Shabbat.\nThe initiative has a number of overall objectives: The speedy resumption of the organization's activities; outreach to isolated elderly in the community; empowering youth by helping them create a better future for themselves; and building a new base of young volunteers.\nIn order to adapt to the newly imposed health and safety regulations, Meir Panim had to change three aspects of its work during the crisis: All of the free restaurants were transformed into centers for take-out meals; the meals-on-wheels delivery service was expanded; and food preparation was done on the premises. Until the crisis, Meir Panim had been the beneficiary of donated surplus food from hotels and event halls, which enabled the organization to serve food which would otherwise have gone to waste.

The organization is in a continuous race against time to prevent the next murder.\nAs the situation escalated, and despite the fear of contagion, on June 1, around 12,000 people demonstrated in Tel Aviv to protest the murder of women, gender-based violence, and the lack of protection and action on the part of the government and local authorities. Samah Salaime, social activist and director of Na'am\u2013AWC, was asked to speak to the demonstrators and many thousands more viewed her speech online and read it in the media. Professor Daphna Hacker of Tel Aviv University later wrote that the speech should be taught to every child in the country and should be part of the compulsory gender education programs in high schools.\nNa\u2019am\u2013AWC, a community-based organization active in the mixed Arab-Jewish cities of Ramla, Lod and Yafo, aims to support women and to bring an end to the phenomenon of femicide, erroneously termed \u201chonor-killing.\u201d The organization has had to step in where municipal, governmental and humanitarian assistance is conspicuously lacking. At the beginning of the lockdown in Israel, the organization launched an emergency program that attempts to\u00a0meet\u00a0the pressing needs of women at risk, combined with a response developed by a national coalition of Arab women\u2019s groups.\nUnderstanding the urgency, the Mandel Foundation provided Na\u2019am\u2013AWC with support for their emergency initiative that addresses critical needs in four main areas at this time: extending the hours of their social workers from three to five days a week; providing vouchers to Arab women and their children who are under threat, in order to enable them to stay in empty hotels or hostels until they find housing (there are not enough women\u2019s shelters in Israel); providing food packages to needy families, especially single-parent mothers (over 150 packages have already been distributed); running advertising campaigns to let women know that help is only a call or a click away, and printing informational flyers with their contact details to be posted in public places.\nIn April, following the brutal murder of Zamzam Mahamid, a young Arab woman who was shot to death in the street by a family member, Na\u2019am\u2013AWC organized a coalition of social-justice organizations for a virtual protest against the murder of women and over 100,000 people participated via social media. During the lockdown, Zamzam, a troubled teen, had been forced to return to her family, where she found herself shut in with her killer.\nAnother young Arab woman whose life was in danger was found during the distribution of food packages. Members of Na'am\u2013AWC were led to her apartment where the woman was hiding from her family. Before the lockdown, the woman had planned to flee the country; however, now she found herself without work, money or food. As soon as the organization members arrived at her door, her 4-year-old daughter rushed to grab a loaf of bread and started eating it ravenously, in a way that made it clear she had not eaten for days.\nIn a recent case, a photo of a young woman who had terrible bruises all over her body was uploaded to Facebook. When the organization located her, after much effort, she turned out to be a 21-year-old mother with a 3-year-old child. The woman had been imprisoned in her home by her husband, who beat her on a daily basis. Together with police and welfare officers, Na'am\u2013AWC moved the mother and child to a battered women\u2019s shelter.\nSome women have also turned to Na'am\u2013AWC for emotional support. A student struggling with regular threats from her abusive brother was encouraged by the organization to seek treatment. Na'am\u2013AWC arranged for her to receive weekly online sessions with a psychotherapist. The organization closely monitors 19 women in similar situations to ensure that they receive support from mental health professionals.\nIn June, Na'am\u2013AWC\u00a0participated in\u00a0an extensive, Arabic-language campaign\u00a0designed\u00a0to remind people, especially during the crisis, of their responsibility to report suspected abuse, as well as to encourage friends, family and neighbors to assist one another. The campaign included two powerful videos that received 1.2 million views and interactions on social media.\nRecently, Samah Salaime was appointed to be a member of an ad hoc committee in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office formed to improve welfare services for women and teens during the coronavirus crisis. In this capacity, she presents the special needs of Arab women. She also reviews the policies implemented in other countries where coronavirus prevention measures have intensified the threat to women, and is currently evaluating which of them would be relevant to adopt in Israel.\nIn 2018, Samah Salaime was named one of the 10 most influential social activists in Israel by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth. In 2019, she was elected to serve as a board member of the Hebrew University. In 2020, Samah Salaime was awarded the Rappaport Prize for Longstanding Achievement.

This raised the need for action that would enable the public to deal with the unfolding crisis \u2014 action that would emphasize community resilience as a central element in dealing with what has become an ongoing state of emergency.\nTwo graduates of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership who are experts in the field of community building teamed up to address this need: Guy Tsfoni, director of Community Strategies, an organization for establishing community resilience and social capital, and Dr. Sara Shadmi-Wortman, an international expert in the field of community building as a process for creating resilient communities. These two Mandel graduates are both involved in MAHUT Israel, a nonprofit organization specializing in emergency preparedness and resilience building.\nThe national initiative established by Tsfoni and Shadmi-Wortman aims to both increase and leverage a community's own strength and capacity with the goal of enabling the continuity of important community functions during the routine stage of the crisis. Designed to be implemented in a total of 80 communities, the program seeks to bolster strength, social solidarity, and the ability to cope in three types of communities: education communities for children and youth, communities of young people (college students and community activists), and communities of senior citizens.\nTo reach its goals, the initiative assembled a team of experts in the fields of emergency, resilience, and community, who are creating a model of community resilience appropriate for a period of extended emergency. The initiative has also developed inter-organizational partnerships that will facilitate implementation of this model in 80 communities across Israel, and is providing training and guidance to the professionals who are employing the model in the communities themselves. The entire process is being documented, monitored, and evaluated by Community Strategies and MAHUT Israel, the initiative's two founding organizations.\nAs part of this collaborative initiative, Tsfoni and Shadmi-Wortman are working with three organizations active in the field, each of which services one of the three target populations: Shvilim, the education network of Israel's rural sector, which is run by the Kibbutz movement; Tozeret Ha\u2019aretz, established by the National Student Union, which operates some 60 student communities in Israel\u2019s socio-geographic periphery; and Kehila Le\u2019Dorot, established by the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC), the Ministry of Welfare, and the Dalia and Eli Hurvitz Foundation, which provides an integrative solution for the needs of senior citizens.\nFor education communities in rural areas, the initial stage of the crisis was particularly difficult, because unlike other systems that transitioned to emergency mode, informal education was largely shut down and most of the professional staff put on leave. Local emergency teams became responsible for children and youth, with community directors, culture coordinators, and volunteers providing alternatives to school. As the crisis unfolded, educators in these rural areas asked themselves why the informal education system was not perceived as an asset and resource for coping with the crisis and why the community resilience it has built for routine times was not suitable in times of emergency.\nTo deal with these questions and the crisis itself, the heads of the initiative embarked on an accelerated process for developing a model of resilience for local community education that is appropriate both for an acute emergency situation and for a scenario in which we are living for an extended period of time in the shadow of the coronavirus. The model is being developed by a multidisciplinary team of experts from different fields together with twelve expert consultants from Shvilim, who work with over 70 educational communities across Israel. The model will be piloted in 30 localities,\u00a0and has\u00a0the\u00a0potential of being implemented in\u00a0as many as 800 communities throughout Israel (regional councils, kibbutzim, and moshavim).\nWithin the communities of young people, when academic studies shut down due to the lockdown, many students became active in the municipal emergency services where they lived. They distributed food and medicine, staffed hotlines, drove people to appointments, and more. In becoming involved in providing emergency services, they were no longer able to fulfill their usual role. In cities in which student communities are active, they increase involvement and the sense of belonging of the local residents. This contributes to community resilience in times of emergency. When the young people abandoned their traditional role and joined efforts to provide for urgent needs, there was no one else to fulfill the role of increasing community resilience during the emergency situation. As part of the initiative, Tozeret Ha'aretz will study what happened during the COVID-19 crisis and will propose new ways of strengthening community resilience both in routine and in times of emergency.\nWith regard to communities of seniors, the initiative is leading a nationwide analysis of the successes and failures of these communities during the coronavirus crisis, in order to produce a professional toolkit for strengthening this population during both periods of acute crisis and a state of ongoing routine emergency. The initiative will publicly appeal to welfare departments, community centers, and senior leadership groups throughout the country to obtain examples of successful community resilience mechanisms that were used for this population during the crisis. The examples that emerge will serve as the basis for a future model for this community. It will initially be piloted in 30 senior communities that will receive intensive training and guidance in implementing the model as preparation for the possibility of future\u00a0waves of COVID-19. After conclusions from the pilot are drawn, the model will then be implemented in 90 localities throughout Israel.\nThis collaborative initiative led by Community Strategies and MAHUT Israel is designed to enable rapid deployment and impact on a national level. By enlisting organizations that work with different populations across the country, the initiative will have an effect on thought leaders, policy makers, heads of educational systems, community workers, change agents, activists, and community leaders throughout Israel. This will allow the program to impact vast swaths of society, infusing the public not only with the discipline to adhere to health regulations, which was the thrust of the first acute stage of the coronavirus crisis, but also with a sense of meaning, belonging, partnership, and involvement. As a result, responsible behavior will become part of the DNA of the community, and will emerge from the bottom up rather than solely from the top down. This will increase the fortitude and solidarity of the community, both in times of acute emergency and during the ongoing state of alert required by the worldwide pandemic.\nPhotos courtesy of Shvilim, the Kibbutz Movement.\n","html_content":"<p>With the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis, municipal and community systems suddenly found themselves in a state of emergency and were&nbsp;forced to shut down and discontinue many of their social and community services, severely impacting a community's ability to cope with the situation. This raised the need for action that would enable the public to deal with the unfolding crisis \u2014 action that would emphasize community resilience as a central element in dealing with what has become an ongoing state of emergency.<\/p>\n<p>Two graduates of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership who are experts in the field of community building teamed up to address this need: \n   <strong>Guy Tsfoni<\/strong>, director of Community Strategies, an organization for establishing community resilience and social capital, and \n   <strong>Dr. Sara Shadmi-Wortman<\/strong>, an international expert in the field of community building as a process for creating resilient communities.  These two Mandel graduates are both involved in MAHUT Israel, a nonprofit organization specializing in emergency preparedness and resilience building.<\/p>\n<p>The national initiative established by Tsfoni and Shadmi-Wortman aims to both increase and leverage a community's own strength and capacity with the goal of enabling the continuity of important community functions during the routine stage of the crisis. Designed to be implemented in a total of 80 communities, the program seeks to bolster strength, social solidarity, and the ability to cope in three types of communities: education communities for children and youth, communities of young people (college students and community activists), and communities of senior citizens.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/resilience-1.jpg\" alt=\"Increasing Community Resilience for an Ongoing Emergency\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<p>To reach its goals, the initiative assembled a team of experts in the fields of emergency, resilience, and community, who are creating a model of community resilience appropriate for a period of extended emergency. The initiative has also developed inter-organizational partnerships that will facilitate implementation of this model in 80 communities across Israel, and is providing training and guidance to the professionals who are employing the model in the communities themselves. The entire process is being documented, monitored, and evaluated by Community Strategies and MAHUT Israel, the initiative's two founding organizations.<\/p>\n<p>As part of this collaborative initiative, Tsfoni and Shadmi-Wortman are working with three organizations active in the field, each of which services one of the three target populations: \n   <strong>Shvilim<\/strong>, the education network of Israel's rural sector, which is run by the Kibbutz movement; \n   <strong>Tozeret Ha\u2019aretz<\/strong>, established by the National Student Union, which operates some 60 student communities in Israel\u2019s socio-geographic periphery; and \n   <strong>Kehila Le\u2019Dorot<\/strong>, established by the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC), the Ministry of Welfare, and the Dalia and Eli Hurvitz Foundation, which provides an integrative solution for the needs of senior citizens.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/resilience-2.jpg\" alt=\"Increasing Community Resilience for an Ongoing Emergency\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<p>For \n   <strong>education communities<\/strong> in rural areas, the initial stage of the crisis was particularly difficult, because unlike other systems that transitioned to emergency mode, informal education was largely shut down and most of the professional staff put on leave. Local emergency teams became responsible for children and youth, with community directors, culture coordinators, and volunteers providing alternatives to school.

The seminar focused in particular on gender equality and on integrating minority groups and people with disabilities into the workplace.\nThe two-day seminar sought to raise awareness of the fact that employee diversity is a leadership and managerial task that requires willpower and conscious decision-making \u2013 not only in order to see those who are different, but also in order to actively choose to employ and integrate such people.

Sharona Bar-Nes, the senior staff member of the Mandel Graduate Unit who initiated the seminar, opened the event by referring to content of the weekly Torah portion as it related to the topic at hand. \u201cMost of us tend to choose those who are similar to us and whom we view as perfect,\" she said. \"In most cases this is an unconscious choice.

Roei spoke about the dramatic personal change he underwent following his injury, and explained that his greatest fear was that he would no longer be able to play a meaningful role in the lives of others. He is now the founder of a company that is involved in leadership development in both the business world and the social sector. He also plays wheelchair basketball at Beit Halochem, and has played competitively in Israel and abroad as a member of Israel's national team for the last six years.\nRoei described his rehabilitation process and his work in leadership development and team building, with an emphasis on people\u2019s natural individual abilities. At the end of the visit, the graduates put together a team that played wheelchair basketball against Roei and Nadav, one of his fellow Beit Halochem team-members. Unsurprisingly, the graduates were soundly beaten.\nThe graduates then visited the Shaare Zedek Medical Center, where they heard from director general Professor Ofer Merin about the value the hospital places on intra-organizational diversity and about the benefits of heterogeneity for the organization. Professor Merin also shared some of the ethical and moral dilemmas he faced when he headed an aid delegation to Nepal following the 2014 earthquake, and spoke about the professional dilemmas that cultural differences raised for the medical teams there. Dr. Alon Schwartz, director of the hospital\u2019s trauma unit, emphasized the importance of heterogeneity as a value, and demonstrated how it is expressed in the work of the diverse teams in the department he heads.\nIn the evening, Adv. Mor Barzani, head of the employment diversity division of Israel's Civil Service Commission, told the graduates about the government\u2019s efforts to introduce regulations that would promote diversity. She noted the influence of these efforts on national resilience and on the public's trust in the establishment. After this presentation, the graduates took part in a group activity in which they reviewed their experiences and identified the main insights they gained from the day\u2019s encounters. They also discussed the question of how best to implement employment diversity policies.\nThe graduates began the second day of the seminar with a visit to the Israel Television News Company, where they were addressed by a panel of journalists comprising Daphna Liel, Knesset affairs correspondent; Branu Tegene, criminal affairs correspondent; and Yair Sherki, religious affairs correspondent. The panel was moderated by Dr. Diana Daaboul and Assael Sharir, graduates of Cohort 24 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, who interviewed the journalists about news and commentary, discussed how difference can become a resource in their particular professional fields, and examined the impact of diversity on the discourse of news and on ratings.\nAfter the panel, the graduates toured the news facility and saw how cooperation between different staff members and other individuals is characteristic of the journalistic process from beginning to end, from early stages of work through the final broadcast on television. Ilana Sarig Hughes, graduate of Cohort 25 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership and director of the Social Cohesion Leadership Program at the Merchavim Institute (a nonprofit organization working to develop heterogeneous organizations that integrate different populations into Israeli society), raised questions and shared insights from the field on the issue of social diversity and social cohesion.\nThe seminar was brought to a close by Dr. Yehuda Maimaran, graduate of Cohort 3 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership and a senior consultant to the Mandel Graduate Unit, who led a review process in which graduates gave feedback and arrived at insights.

The sessions, which enable peer learning and mutual development, offer graduates an opportunity to create groups of belonging; to share knowledge, successes, dilemmas, and challenges; and to consult with one another. The knowledge, insights, and experience of the group enable its members to examine issues from different perspectives and to suggest alternative interpretations and new courses of action.\nThe series centers on subjects that are relevant to the graduates\u2019 work and is built in response to needs that arise in the field. Issues and challenges that have been raised for discussion include: documentation; conceptualization and creation of a model for disseminating knowledge while maintaining quality and remaining faithful to the original; developing ideas and growing the initiative while managing a routine heavy workload; creating and adopting a unique language that is used across the organization; implementing a unique new approach and making it accessible; and managing the challenges that arise in relation to parents and the education system when implementing change.\n\nThe series maintains the Mandel tradition of moving back and forth between theory and practice. At the first meeting, the graduates briefly presented their educational initiatives, and then took part in a joint study session. Titled \u201cBetween the Familiar and the Strange,\u201d the study session was facilitated by Israel Sorek, a graduate of Cohort 2 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership and a faculty member of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev. The discussion examined the natural human tendency to reject that which is foreign. It pointed out that entrepreneurial work runs counter to this tendency, as entrepreneurs, like artists, transform that which is familiar into something strange.

The sessions, which enable peer learning and mutual development, offer graduates an opportunity to create groups of belonging; to share knowledge, successes, dilemmas, and challenges; and to consult with one another. The knowledge, insights, and experience of the group enable its members to examine issues from different perspectives and to suggest alternative interpretations and new courses of action.<\/p>\n<p>The series centers on subjects that are relevant to the graduates\u2019 work and is built in response to needs that arise in the field. Issues and challenges that have been raised for discussion include: documentation; conceptualization and creation of a model for disseminating knowledge while maintaining quality and remaining faithful to the original; developing ideas and growing the initiative while managing a routine heavy workload; creating and adopting a unique language that is used across the organization; implementing a unique new approach and making it accessible; and managing the challenges that arise in relation to parents and the education system when implementing change.<\/p>\n<div> \n   <br> \n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Pedagogical-Renewal-2020.jpg\" alt=\"Pedagogical Renewal and the Dynamics of Innovation\" class=\"img-responsive\"> \n   <br> \n<\/div>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p>The series maintains the Mandel tradition of moving back and forth between theory and practice.

On December 23, 2019, the Mandel Graduate unit held an event in partnership with Yafet, in which he presented this initiative, which is based on a vision that he developed as a Mandel fellow.\n\u201cReady for Tomorrow\u201d works to advance fundamental values of equality, justice, and social mobility via education and integration into the workforce. The initiative aims to promote, empower, and train youth and young adults from the Ethiopian-Israeli community and to prepare them for entering high-quality professions, mainly in the fields of health and medicine.\nYafet, who works as a nurse at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, is familiar with the severe lack of personnel in the medical and health professions in Israel, and is aware of the significant under-representation of Ethiopian-Israelis in these fields. He sees the existing situation not only as a challenge, but also as an opportunity to create change by training and guiding young Ethiopian-Israelis into these professions. This will help address the needs of the labor market while offering these young people the opportunity of high-quality professional employment, and improving the cultural accessibility of Israel\u2019s health system for the Ethiopian community.\nThe Mandel Graduate Unit has supported Yafet throughout the process of developing his initiative.

He also discussed the link between educational excellence and social responsibility.\nThe guests who attended the event at Yafet\u2019s invitation included figures from the worlds of medicine, law, and academia, as well as leaders and entrepreneurs from the Ethiopian-Israeli community and other sectors of society. Dr. Yehezkel Caine, CEO of the Herzog Medical Center, spoke about the success of Herzog\u2019s training programs in the nursing professions and the contribution of these programs to the Center and to the program participants. These programs enable participants to enter a profession that is a source of pride and steady income, with possibilities for advancement. Dr. Caine also noted that \u201dReady for Tomorrow\u201d is just one example of training for the health professions, and expressed support for the intention to expand the program to encompass all health and medical professions, in order to increase the participants\u2019 freedom of choice.\n\nShaul Gelbard, CEO of Bank Yahav, said that \u201dReady for Tomorrow\u201d has the potential to grow even further and to include additional areas of education for excellence, such as technology, sport, finance, and more. Naftali Avraham, who was the CEO of Tech-Career until recently and is now CEO of the Ethiopian Jewry Heritage Center (a government corporation), presented a model for the initiative that focuses on a single discipline. He spoke about the success of the Center for Technology Training for Young Ethiopian Israelis and about the growing integration of these young people into the Israeli hi-tech industry: There has been a rise from four Ethiopian Israeli hi-tech employees in the year that Tech-Career was founded (2002), to hundreds of young Ethiopian-Israelis who are now working in hi-tech. (The Center successful placement rate is 89%.)\nDr. Simcha Getahune, chair of the National Institute for Ethiopian Jewry Heritage Center and former head of multi-cultural affairs at ELEM\u2014Youth in Distress, spoke about the great motivation of young Ethiopian-Israelis to progress and develop, and of the need to give them a strong sense of belief and hope. Justice (ret.) Shlomo Shoham emphasized the importance of giving freedom of choice and a range of possibilities, and proposed focusing on the needs of the target audience rather than on goals.\nDoron Haran, vice chairman for resource development at Ono Academic College, and Adv. Ze\u2019ev Kasu, director of the program for Ethiopian Israelis at Ono College and treasurer of Yafet\u2019s nonprofit, spoke about the success of Ethiopian-Israeli students at Ono College and about its pragmatic operational model, which provides a solid basis for success.\nTwo particularly moving speakers were Dr. Daniel Mashasha, a young member of the Ethiopian-Israeli community who recently completed his studies at the Hadassah Medical Center School of Medicine, and Esther Alemu Wexler, a film director who is highly regarded both in Israel and internationally. Daniel spoke of his special journey to become a doctor. Esther, who is Yafet\u2019s daughter, showed a scene from a film that she directed that was based on her childhood experiences at school, and spoke of how her father supported her and encouraged her to reach her goals, stand up for her beliefs, and believe in herself.\nDr. Sarit Barzilai, an expert in narrative training who, like Yafet, is a graduate of Cohort 11 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, spoke about her longstanding friendship with Yafet and about his leadership qualities.

Founded by Tzipora Gutman, a graduate of Cohort 24 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, the village provides young women from the Haredi community with a supportive environment in which they receive a high-quality general education alongside a rich curriculum of religious studies. The village was developed as part of Tzipora's personal project as a fellow at the Mandel School.\u00a0\nStudents at Kfar Shira receive an opportunity for learning, growth, and self-actualization in accordance with their own personal, cultural, and social worldviews and beliefs. Their exposure to the world outside of the Haredi community positions them as change agents, and challenges the traditional Haredi approach that seeks to preserve the status quo. The process that students undergo at the village influences Haredi discourse regarding the acceptance of difference and diversity, thus having an impact that extends far beyond the boundaries of the village itself.\nDuring November 2019, graduates and faculty members of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership participated in a site visit to this groundbreaking social-educational initiative to learn about it firsthand.\u00a0\nThe students at Kfar Shira are young women with strong opinions who were unable to meet the strict demands of Haredi educational frameworks, and who are seen by the Haredi community as \u201cdropout youth.\u201d Tzipora's view of these young women is completely different. As she sees it, the very same characteristics that led these students to leave the community are actually a valuable resource and source of strength, which can offer opportunities for growth and development and enable the students to become leaders in the future.\nThe educational approach of the village values the unique personalities and talents of every student. It aims to provide guidance and tools that enable the young women to cope with their process of growing up in a positive way, to channel their strengths in a constructive manner, and to achieve significant accomplishments. As Tzipora described it: \u201cIt is no coincidence that the Mandel Foundation has chosen to invest in developing a leadership program for the students at Kfar Shira.

Founded by \n   <strong>Tzipora Gutman<\/strong>, a graduate of Cohort 24 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, the village provides young women from the Haredi community with a supportive environment in which they receive a high-quality general education alongside a rich curriculum of religious studies. The village was developed as part of Tzipora's personal project as a fellow at the Mandel School.<br>&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"Tzipora Gutman and faculty and graduates of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership\" src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Kfar-Shira1.jpg\">\n   <span style=\"color:#777777;\">Tzipora Guttman, far right, with faculty and graduates of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>Students at Kfar Shira receive an opportunity for learning, growth, and self-actualization in accordance with their own personal, cultural, and social worldviews and beliefs. Their exposure to the world outside of the Haredi community positions them as change agents, and challenges the traditional Haredi approach that seeks to preserve the status quo. The process that students undergo at the village influences Haredi discourse regarding the acceptance of difference and diversity, thus having an impact that extends far beyond the boundaries of the village itself.<\/p>\n<p>During November 2019, graduates and faculty members of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership participated in a site visit to this groundbreaking social-educational initiative to learn about it firsthand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The students at Kfar Shira are young women with strong opinions who were unable to meet the strict demands of Haredi educational frameworks, and who are seen by the Haredi community as \u201cdropout youth.\u201d Tzipora's view of these young women is completely different. As she sees it, the very same characteristics that led these students to leave the community are actually a valuable resource and source of strength, which can offer opportunities for growth and development and enable the students to become leaders in the future.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"Students at Kfar Shira\" src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Kfar-Shira2.jpg\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<p>The educational approach of the village values the unique personalities and talents of every student. It aims to provide guidance and tools that enable the young women to cope with their process of growing up in a positive way, to channel their strengths in a constructive manner, and to achieve significant accomplishments. As Tzipora described it: \u201cIt is no coincidence that the Mandel Foundation has chosen to invest in developing a leadership program for the students at Kfar Shira. The young women at the village clearly have the strength and qualities of leaders, and are our hope for a better future.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tzipora stressed that setting up a residential educational framework outside the physical setting of the Haredi community facilitates a process of rapprochement between the students and the community, and enables the students to maintain relations with their families and to avoid a descent into alienation and anger. \n   <strong>Zehava Tamir<\/strong>, the coordinator of the leadership program at Kfar Shira, explained that the leadership program places a premium on developing a strong, ethical Jewish identity, and on reconnecting the students to their families and communities.

Tzipora Gutman, graduate of Cohort 24, and founder and director of Shira Village, a youth village for girls from Haredi homes who have chosen a different path for themselves, spoke about the process of founding the village, which began as an idea for her personal project at\u00a0the Mandel School and which was realized after she completed the program.\u00a0The village is a unique framework that provides young women who have departed from their Haredi lifestyle with a high-quality general education that includes full bagrut matriculation, alongside extensive Jewish studies and a supportive environment.\n\nDr. Miriam Korkus-Panoyan, graduate of Cohort 7 and director of the Zichron Yaakov municipal education department, spoke about the multi-generational link between young leaders in their formative stages and more senior leaders.

Odeya Barkan, a graduate of Cohort 22, musician, and coordinator of Jewish and Arab music studies at Ono Academic College, spoke about music as a bridge between worlds, and about the challenge of finding interfaces between the two Jewish and Arab tracks of study while maintaining their very different identities.

The increase in life expectancy and the unique characteristics of this stage of life raise dilemmas, questions, and opportunities that require analysis and consideration. Beyond this, the unique nature of Mandel graduate requires a different approach to certain aspects of retirement than what is commonly found in the retirement preparation courses of other frameworks.\nOn September 19, 2019, the Mandel Graduate Unit hosted a meeting that surveyed the range of possibilities and analyzed the challenges that typify this stage of life. Issues discussed included:\nIs continuing professional development and involvement after retirement age a matter of special importance to members of the Mandel graduate\u00a0community?\u00a0Is this stage in life an opportunity for graduates to continue their existing professional involvement or perhaps to study new content with which they had not been engaged prior to their retirement?Is it possible to utilize the knowledge and experience of retiring Mandel graduates? If so, how? Should that knowledge and experience be directed inward, within the Mandel graduate community, or toward the fields of education and society in the broad sense?Does the Mandel Graduate Unit have a role to play at this stage of life?

Mr. Mandel noted that the reward for such service is not financial; rather, it stems from the knowledge that the organization has improved as a result of your involvement in its board.\nMr. Mandel emphasized the importance of values as a compass for behavior. He stressed that integrity, honesty, respect, and generosity are the values that should guide the actions of every human being, and called on the graduates to be \u201cfighters\u201d in the struggle to ensure proper conduct of the boards of which they are members. Success, he told the graduates, is the ability to look in the mirror and be proud of who you have been and who you are, secure in the knowledge that you are a \u201cmensch.\u201d\u00a0\nMr. Mandel also spoke about the relationship between a board's chair and CEO. He explained that it is the chair\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the CEO\u2019s actions reflect the organization\u2019s principles. This supervision is oversight, not interference, and must be carried out by the chair with respect and discretion. At the end of the fascinating and inspiring discussion, the graduates thanked Mr. Mandel for sharing his insights with them.\nThe session started with a lecture by Attorney Yoav Lalum, a graduate of cohort 23 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership and a participant in the training program for directors and board members. He spoke about conflicts of interest and favoritism in administrative law, which is the foundation for the rules governing conflicts of interest in corporate law. He explained the difference between personal conflicts of interest, institutional conflicts of interest, and favoritism. He also spoke about conflicts of interest in appointments committees, the impact of breaches of regulations regarding conflicts of interest, and ways of avoiding such breaches.\u00a0\nNext, Limor Edri-Elimelech, an accountant, lecturer, and financial management consultant for businesses and social organizations, spoke about financial reports. She presented information and tools necessary for analyzing the content of these documents, and emphasized that a director or board member must be able to understand financial reports independently, without relying on other members of the company. She also explained that financial reports are a summary and must be read with an appreciation of their organizational context: they require an understanding of the financial implications of the information they contain based on additional study and a broad perspective, which can be achieved by meeting with members of the organization in the field and examining processes and activities that are being carried out in practice.\nEyal Globus, head of the Israeli Corporations Authority at the Ministry of Justice, gave a lecture on regulation in the non-profit sector that explored the similarities and differences between the role and responsibilities of the boards of businesses and non-profit organizations. He reviewed the organizational structure and mission of Israel's Corporations Authority; contrasted the Companies and Partnerships Registrar with the [Non-profit] Associations Registrar (the former is a support body for the business sector, Israeli commerce, and the workings of the economy, while the latter is responsible for ensuring the proper functioning of non-profit corporations). Globus noted that there is greater oversight of nonprofits than of businesses because nonprofits use public and government funds. He reviewed the roles and responsibilities of the general assembly, the board of directors, the audit committee, the auditing accountant, and the internal auditor, as well as the guiding principles, challenges, and main actors in the area of regulation of non-profit corporations.\n","html_content":"<p>\n   <strong>\u200bMorton L.

The first two sessions of the program, which is being conducted under the auspices of the Mandel Graduate Unit, were held over two days, on the last Wednesday and Thursday of December 2017.\nThe program opened with a lecture by Professor Eugene Kandel, CEO of the non-profit organization Start-Up Nation Central, and a professor of economics and finance at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem\u2019s School of Business Administration. Between 2009 and 2015 Professor Kandel served as the Head of the National Economic Council and as the Economic Adviser to the Prime Minister, and played a central role in all major decisions on economic policy.\nProfessor Kandel provided a review of the overall socioeconomic situation in Israel, and spoke about the widely-held idea that there is a tension between economic behavior that seeks to advance the interests of specific organizations and between pro-social values, especially when businesses are involved. According to Prof. Kandel, this idea is false; it is rooted in the fact that resources are limited, and thus economic decisions require prioritization and analysis of alternatives based on their cost.\u00a0\nIn Professor Kandel\u2019s opinion, the realm of economics is no more or less moral than other disciplines. However, it requires us to face unpleasant issues and to choose between alternatives. Economics holds up a \"mirror\" to reality, shows the alternatives available for any decision, and clarifies the scale of costs. \"Progress has always been driven by economic development and by nurturing the forces that lead it,\u201d he said. \u201cDelegitimizing the forces of market growth will lead to stagnation and the halting of progress. You are about to enter a world that is new to you, in which you will have to make decisions that might make you feel uncomfortable when faced with the possible alternatives.\u201d\nProfessor Kandel described the uncertainty that characterizes today\u2019s economy and discussed the global trends that influence it. These include the global economic crisis of the first decade of the 21st century, the effects of which are still being felt; the aging of the world\u2019s population; globalization and the shift of the world\u2019s economic center of gravity to the emerging economies of East Asia; and the digital revolution. He explained how the rapid pace of change demands constant and drastic changes in our way of thinking, and requires that we develop behavior that is both strategic and adaptive.\nAdv. Ronit Abramson, an expert in business and company law, who is serving as the professional consultant for the program, gave a lecture on company law, reviewing basic concepts such as the composition of the board of directors, its role, and its powers. Rakefet Mossek, director of consultations at the Mandel Graduate Unit, who developed and heads the program, introduced the participants to the program's unique concept, as well as to its goals and its course requirements.\nThe second day of the program began with a lecture from Adv. Avraham Well, a partner in Fischer, Behar, Chen, Well, Orion, & Co., in which he presented the \u201ctriangle of power\u201d in companies: the general assembly, the board of directors, and the management. Adv. Well described the differences between the roles of these three bodies, which can sometimes become blurred.\nAdv. Davida Lachman-Messer, formerly a deputy attorney general, gave a lecture that focused on fundamental concepts. These included the types of companies defined in Israel's Companies Law (private companies, public companies, bonds companies, and public benefit companies) and the differences between them; the problem of representation on business boards, as opposed to representation on the boards of non-profit organizations and public benefit companies; and the stock market, the actors involved in it, and the role of institutional investors.\nProf. Pierre Kletz, the founder and director of the Mandel Social Leadership MBA Program at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, spoke about the changes taking place in the makeup of boards of directors around the world, and about the trend of incorporating practices and methods from the public and private sectors into the non-profit sector. Prof. Kletz noted that while civil society used to be almost entirely unrepresented in private sector boardrooms, the great majority of leading businesses around the world now have representatives from the social sector on their boards.\nDr. Granit Almog-Bareket, the director of the Mandel Graduate Unit, discussed the role of the vision-driven board in educational and social organizations, and noted the new trend for non-profits to engage in for-profit activities alongside their philanthropic activities, which enables them to attain economic independence and stability. Dr. Almog-Bareket described how it is possible to have an impact and to work toward social and educational change by serving on boards of directors.

The study trip, which took place from July 16-23 2017, allowed the graduates to examine the issue of refugees and migration in contemporary Europe from a global perspective, while also gaining a local view of the waves of migration the country has experienced. Macedonia was chosen because of its central position in the movement of refugees through the Balkans: during the refugee crisis in Europe in 2015-2016, more than 700,000 refugees and migrants passed through its borders.\nDr. Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia, hosts Mandel graduates at the President's Residence in Ohrid\nDuring the trip, the graduates learned about the phenomenon of migration in Macedonia from several perspectives: crisis management, decision-making processes, changes in policy and legislation, economic and social limitations. They also explored influential international factors such as change in policies of the European Union, the relations between Macedonia and Greece, and Macedonia\u2019s request to join the European Union and NATO.\nThe week began with a trip to the Gevgelija refugee camp on the border with Greece, which serves as the entry point for migrants arriving in Macedonia mainly from Syria and Iraq via Turkey and Greece. There, the group was hosted by the director of the refugee camp and by the local police commissioner. They met with an array of senior officials: the ministers of labor and social policy, defense, and culture, as well as the former foreign minister, who led the negotiations with EU countries during the refugee crisis.\nThe graduates heard both formal and informal voices. One of the high points of the trip was a two-hour meeting with the President of Macedonia, Dr. Gjorge Ivanov, who provided a detailed review of the historical context of migration, and explained the financial and multicultural challenges it poses, for both the present and the future. The informal voices included the Mufti of Bitola (the second-largest city after the capital, Skopje), and representatives of local and international aid organizations who are active in the refugee camps and who work with asylum seekers (of whom there have been very few).\n\nWhile the history of the Jewish community in Macedonia was not the focus of the visit, the story of this small community, which dates back to the 16th century, was a recurring theme throughout the trip. The graduates visited the Jewish cemetery in Bitola, which is being renovated at the initiative of young local residents. In the capital city of Skopje, they visited the site from which the entire Jewish community of Macedonia \u2013 7,144 men, women, and children \u2013 were sent to Treblinka in March 1943. None of them survived. They toured the Holocaust Memorial Center for the Jews of Macedonia, which was established by a foundation funded by the government of Macedonia. The group also met with the president of the Jewish community of Macedonia, which numbers some 200 people, and attended a Shabbat dinner at the community center.\nThe study trip was planned in partnership with Ambassador Dan Oryan, Israel\u2019s non-resident ambassador to Macedonia and director of the Balkans Section at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was the driving force behind arranging the high-level meetings that allowed the group to hear such a diverse range of voices.

Macedonia was chosen because of its central position in the movement of refugees through the Balkans: during the refugee crisis in Europe in 2015-2016, more than 700,000 refugees and migrants passed through its borders.<\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Macedonia-Group_B.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Gjorge Ivanov President of Macedonia, hosts Mandel graduates at the President's Residence \" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<p> \n   <span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Dr. Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia, hosts Mandel graduates at the President's Residence in Ohrid<span><br><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>During the trip, the graduates learned about the phenomenon of migration in Macedonia from several perspectives: crisis management, decision-making processes, changes in policy and legislation, economic and social limitations. They also explored influential international factors such as change in policies of the European Union, the relations between Macedonia and Greece, and Macedonia\u2019s request to join the European Union and NATO.<\/p>\n<p>The week began with a trip to the Gevgelija refugee camp on the border with Greece, which serves as the entry point for migrants arriving in Macedonia mainly from Syria and Iraq via Turkey and Greece. There, the group was hosted by the director of the refugee camp and by the local police commissioner. They met with an array of senior officials: the ministers of labor and social policy, defense, and culture, as well as the former foreign minister, who led the negotiations with EU countries during the refugee crisis.<\/p>\n<p>The graduates heard both formal and informal voices. One of the high points of the trip was a two-hour meeting with the President of Macedonia, Dr. Gjorge Ivanov, who provided a detailed review of the historical context of migration, and explained the financial and multicultural challenges it poses, for both the present and the future. The informal voices included the Mufti of Bitola (the second-largest city after the capital, Skopje), and representatives of local and international aid organizations who are active in the refugee camps and who work with asylum seekers (of whom there have been very few).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>While the history of the Jewish community in Macedonia was not the focus of the visit, the story of this small community, which dates back to the 16th century, was a recurring theme throughout the trip. The graduates visited the Jewish cemetery in Bitola, which is being renovated at the initiative of young local residents. In the capital city of Skopje, they visited the site from which the entire Jewish community of Macedonia \u2013 7,144 men, women, and children \u2013 were sent to Treblinka in March 1943. None of them survived. They toured the Holocaust Memorial Center for the Jews of Macedonia, which was established by a foundation funded by the government of Macedonia. The group also met with the president of the Jewish community of Macedonia, which numbers some 200 people, and attended a Shabbat dinner at the community center.<\/p>\n<p>The study trip was planned in partnership with Ambassador Dan Oryan, Israel\u2019s non-resident ambassador to Macedonia and director of the Balkans Section at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was the driving force behind arranging the high-level meetings that allowed the group to hear such a diverse range of voices. During the trip, the group also attended a formal reception organized by the ambassador to mark Israel\u2019s Independence Day.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Macedonia-UNHCR_B.jpg\" alt=\"Mandel graduates tour refugee camp in Macedonia\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<br>\n","images":{"macedonia-group_b.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Macedonia-Group_B.jpg","caption":""},"macedonia-unhcr_b.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Macedonia-UNHCR_B.jpg","caption":""}},"attachments":[],"outer_links":[]},"building-a-partnership":{"title":"Building Partnerships: First Session for Upcoming Graduates","date":"2017-06-26","image":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Building-Partnership-S.jpg","excerpt":"The Mandel Graduate Unit held a first group activity for the fellows of Cohort 24 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/graduates.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Building-a-Partnership.aspx","is_inner":"yes","slug":"building-a-partnership","text":"\u200bOn June 26th, the Mandel Graduate Unit welcomed the fellows of Cohort 24 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, whose two-year program is coming to an end.

Entitled \u201cNetworked Management and Complexity,\u201d it focused on contemporary management challenges. \n   <strong>Avner Hacohen<\/strong>, a clinical psychologist and organizational consultant who serves as a consultant for the Mandel Graduate Unit, led a fascinating discussion that combined a review of new theoretical paradigms with the personal experiences of the graduates in their professional settings.<\/p>\n<p>The Mandel Graduate Unit\u2019s continuation programs are based on the premise that the cohort as a whole is an important resource for its members, and that graduates who work in a diverse range of fields can benefit from each other\u2019s professional knowledge. The programs are designed to create a safe and intimate space for examining professional dilemmas, studying the latest developments in education and society, and creating a community of learners within the graduate community.<\/p>\n<p>The sessions provide graduates with opportunities to discuss personal and professional issues and challenges, as well as the organizational environments in which they operate.
