with the support of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation, created SidraTarbut (CulturEvents) \u2013 a unique summer festival blending together film, dance, theater and music. Over the months of August and September, Jerusalem is treated to a rich series of events and artistic offerings that span the entire city and are offered free of charge or for a symbolic fee. Performances and events are selected and adapted to neighborhood residents, taking into consideration each community's special characteristics and population. Among the events are concerts, theatrical productions, film screenings, dance performances, storytelling, poetry readings, drum circles, circus performances and more.\nThe initial impetus for the series was the economic and social crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In that difficult period, the Mandel Foundation sought to mitigate some of the negative effects of the pandemic by offering emergency grants to a variety of organizations. One such grant was awarded to the Jerusalem Foundation for SidraTarbut, an innovative initiative designed to strengthen the cultural life of Jerusalem's residents and to provide a valuable opportunity for Jerusalem artists and performers to demonstrate their talents on stage to a broad public audience. The events of the series span East and West Jerusalem, secular, ultra-Orthodox and national religious communities, and neighborhoods that are ranked low and high on the socioeconomic scale. The varied offerings appeal both to enthusiast culture lovers and the general public of all ages.\n\nFollowing the success of SidraTarbut in the summer of 2021, the Mandel Foundation decided to support the festival for another two years. In 2022, SidraTarbut events were held across 34 neighborhoods throughout the city, with a total of 64 performances that were enjoyed by a variety of audiences totaling over 15,000 people.\u00a0 Many of the participating artists and cultural leaders are graduates of the Mandel Program for Leadership in Jewish Culture, which aims to contribute to the vitality and diversity of Jewish culture in Israel by investing in leaders in education, culture, and community.\nSidraTarbut will be opening in mid-August for the third year in a row. For 40 days and nights, residents of Jerusalem will be able to participate in an array of performances \u2013 music, dance, theater, film and more \u2013 free of charge or for a nominal fee. The performances will take place in well-known venues and unusual spaces that will be specially adapted to host the festival this year.\n\n\n\nHighlights of the SidraTarbut festival of 2022\u00a0\n","html_content":"<p>\u200b<img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/sidrat-2023.jpg\" alt=\"Brightly lit night concert at the Tower of David in Jerusalem\" class=\"img-responsive\"><span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">The closing event of SidraTarbut 2022 was a Tahrir-style Selichot event at the Tower of David, between Jerusalem\u2019s Old City walls.

Organized by the Mandel Library and Resource Center, the conference began with a presentation by Liad Mousan Shemesh, the Foundation\u2019s librarian and information specialist, who recounted how the library was established and surveyed current efforts aimed at its continued development.\nThe library and resource center of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel serves all members of the Mandel community. Its purpose is to make high-quality and relevant information available to practitioners in the fields of education, society, and culture via online access to information systems. It also provides various support services, including individual consultations using advanced information technologies. Rachel Zeitoun, coordinator of the Forum of Directors of College Libraries in Israel, noted that considerable effort, planning, and resources were invested in the conference, which centered around a discussion of the main issues of concern to information specialists and to the members of the Mandel community.\nDuring the second part of the event, participants split into discussion groups and examined challenges facing the libraries of Israel\u2019s academic colleges, as well as the Mandel library. Subjects discussed included the use of advanced technologies in the work of information specialists; information literacy in the Haredi and Arab publics; the use of libraries from the perspective of learners; research based on regional needs; researching and retrieving relevant information for practitioners; and making information systems accessible to all users.\nThe group discussions generated several important and interesting insights:\nWe live in an age in which content is created and sold digitally and free access to materials is constantly increasing, while library budgets are being cut at the same time. Consequently, it is important to ramp up collaboration within the library ecosystem, based on agreements for inter-library loans.With the growing accessibility and use of generative AI, the work of information specialists is changing dramatically. Traditionally, their role was that of a consultant. They encouraged researchers to understand the underlying principles of the work and concepts being explored, developed a search strategy for navigating between different information resources, helped researchers understand the limitations of their work, and sought ways of bridging information gaps.\u00a0 Today, their work has been augmented by modern research tools such as information retrieval systems and generative AI platforms, which require expertise.Generative AI must be used carefully and with a critical eye. Users need help in formulating and reformulating research questions, presenting different views, setting out the broad context of the issue at hand, sorting content into working categories, and defining keywords. AI text generators can also be a useful tool for students and fellows with learning disabilities.\n\nLibraries must make the effort to provide culturally adapted services for populations that need them; for example, they must come up with solutions for addressing the language challenges of Arabic speakers in a Hebrew environment, or gaps in literacy among Haredi users. There is a significant lack of librarians who are trained to provide culturally adapted services. Accordingly, a national body should be developed that can share information about making content accessible to different populations and about ways to improve the provision of culturally adapted services in institutions of higher education.The Mandel Centers for Leadership in the North and in the Negev pointed out the need for developing regional approaches \u2013 a need that is shared by colleges where students carry out practicums. Librarians or information specialists with particular expertise in a certain region are able to find focused information and research that is not necessarily accessible to the wider public. Participants in the group that discussed this matter agreed that there is a considerable amount of hidden information that emerges from search queries and consultations.How should the immense quantity of knowledge in libraries be made accessible to users? The group that focused on this challenge concluded that a promising approach is to embed information specialists into study programs, particularly during program components that require the development of research skills. Libraries should offer training that explains the mechanical and technological rationale behind search engines, focusing on how to formulate questions and create searches using strategic words. They should also provide research skills and critical approaches to information sources at the beginning of the learning process. Providing such training for students and fellows also forges good relations with information specialists and promotes more in-depth study.\nThe challenges facing the Mandel Foundation\u2019s library are shared by other libraries and information centers around Israel.

In one session, visiting faculty member Malka Puterkovsky explored different readings of the Israeli Declaration of Independence with Dov Elbaum, editor of \n   <em>Israeli Talmud: Tractate Independence<\/em>, an anthology of 160 essays in honor of the 75th anniversary of Israel\u2019s founding.<br><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Fellows-Day-2023-2.jpg\" alt=\"Discussion between three fellows\" class=\"img-responsive\"> \n   <span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Fellows exchanging ideas (Photo: Simanim)<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p><br>Next, the fellows had a choice of experiential performances:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n      <strong>Maqam<\/strong> \u2013 A multicultural musical encounter by the Israeli Andalusian Orchestra\u2013Ashdod, which weaves together strands of East and West, holy and secular, new and old, and classical and folk.<\/li><li>\n      <strong>Embracing Post-Trauma<\/strong> \u2013 A conversation with director Ari Pullman, who discussed his films, which explore critical crossroads faced by Israeli society throughout its history.<\/li><li>\n      <strong>The Void<\/strong> \u2013 An encounter with the Kometz Theater, which was created in Beer Sheva in response to the lack of cultural experiences that were available during the COVID-19 pandemic&nbsp;and&nbsp;which presents texts to audiences in a minimalist fashion.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> \n   <br> \n<\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Fellows-Day-2023-3.jpg\" alt=\"Director Ari Pullman\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Ari Pullman discusses his films (Photo: Simanim)<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <br>At the end of the day, the fellows gathered into their respective program cohorts to share and process their experiences and insights.

new Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Campus and Building of the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design\u00a0Jerusalem was inaugurated on November 10, 2022. The Mandel Foundation is the lead donor for the new campus, which reflects the Foundation's commitment to promoting the arts and institutions of higher learning in Israel, as well as its commitment to the city of Jerusalem.\nLocated in the heart of the city, next to the Russian Compound, Bezalel's new campus will serve 2,500 students and 500 faculty members in a state-of-the-art facility. Bezalel\u2019s move from its Mount Scopus campus, which is somewhat removed from the city center, is expected to transform downtown Jerusalem and make it a hub of student life, and to reinforce Israel\u2019s capital as a national and international center for culture and creativity.\nDesigned by the renowned SANAA Architects from Japan, the 400,000-square-foot building will house workshops, classrooms, galleries, studios, offices, auditoriums, a library, and a cafeteria. The building's transparent design is a central architectural feature reflecting Bezalel's new pedagogical approaches and its aspiration to play an active, meaningful role in the life of the city it has called home since 1906. This transparency creates lines of sight that are unimpeded throughout the building and from the building to the surrounding streets, encouraging unprecedented academic collaborations and interdisciplinary activities as well as interactions between Bezalel students and the city's inhabitants. The building invites the Jerusalem community to take a look inside, visit its galleries and library, attend conferences and events, and become a part of Bezalel's day-to-day life.\n\nThe inauguration ceremony was attended by a number of dignitaries, including President Isaac Herzog and his wife First Lady\u00a0Michal Herzog, Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion, Bezalel President Professor Adi Stern, Bezalel's Chairman of the Board Dan Meridor, Japanese Ambassador Mr. Koichi Aiboshi, two representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church and Mandel Foundation President and CEO Professor Jehuda Reinharz and Mandel Foundation Chairman of the Board\u00a0Steve Hoffman.\n\u201cWe expect that here, in the city center of Jerusalem, we will have a vibrant urban campus whose design echoes the blurring of boundaries between internal and external, between old and new, and between art and city life,\u201d said Professor Jehuda Reinharz in his address to those gathered. \u201cWe at the Mandel Foundation are proud to make such a transformative contribution to the city and to art, and thereby to be part of this movement toward the future \u2013 the future of Jerusalem, and the future of Israeli art.\"\nThe new Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Campus will enable Israel's oldest Academy to continue to shape the future of art, design and architecture in Israel, the region and abroad.

She also asks why various grassroots pedagogical initiatives, many of which have been successful on a small scale and have created islands of excellence, have been unable to connect to form comprehensive change. For many years now, Professor Zohar has been studying the teaching and learning of higher order thinking and their place in current pedagogical theories. She is closely familiar with the various attempts made over the years to implement innovative pedagogical programs in the Israeli education system, some of which she led herself, and argues that despite such developments, these islands of innovation have not been linked together into a coherent whole. The book takes as a case study the reform advanced by Professor Zohar when she served as chair of the Pedagogical Secretariat at the Education Ministry, which involved a comprehensive effort to implement processes of higher order thinking and deep understanding throughout the education system.\nThe answer she proposes is to shift the focus of reform from change processes that emphasize structures and administration toward broader and deeper pedagogical processes. Professor Zohar interprets the concept of \u201cpedagogy\u201d as being the essence of teaching and learning, which she believes requires in-depth knowledge gained over many years, encompassing theory, research, and traditions of learning. She reminds readers that at the heart of all activity in schools is the acquisition of deep knowledge and thinking strategies, and thus educational change efforts must include elements of \u201csubstantive pedagogy\u201d that address these elements rather than target mainly administrative elements. Just as the aim of school-based learning is the construction of knowledge and thinking strategies, so the aim of leaders of pedagogical change should be the acquisition of deep knowledge about teaching processes and their implementation \u2013 from the early stages of teacher training, through professional development of teachers, to assessment and the planning and development of curricula.\nIn one of the book\u2019s central chapters, Professor Zohar encourages educational leaders to be instructional leaders \u2013 that is, pedagical\u00a0\u2013 and teaching-oriented leaders, who recognize the importance of examining the pedagogical essence of changes, rather than just deciding on the structures of change. This will enable the professionals leading educational change processes to address the deeper goals of teaching and learning in an informed and methodical way, to look for ways to attain these goals, and thus to advance the desired improvement in education in Israel.\nWritten by\u00a0Ruth Lehavi\n\n\n\n\nThe Birth of Doubt: Confronting Uncertainty in Early Rabbinic LiteratureBy Professor Moshe HalbertalMagnes Press (Hebrew)Brown Judaic Studies (English)\nIn The Birth of Doubt, Professor Moshe Halbertal examines the halakhic\u00a0(legal)\u00a0rulings of the tanaim (the rabbinical sages of the first and second centuries CE), which were formulated in conditions of doubt and uncertainty. The book will also be of interest to readers who are not familiar with early halakhic literature, as the principles that Professor Halbertal proposes for clarifying these rulings are also applicable to the timeless existential need for mediation between the ability to read reality (an ability that is always limited for human beings) and the human desire to operate with certainty in conditions of doubt and to avoid the costs of error they invite.\nIn a personal conversation about his research, Professor Halbertal spoke about the rabbinical concept of \u201cbein hashmashot\u201d (twilight, literally \u201cbetween the suns,\u201d which is discussed in chapter 6 of the book. This concept describes a situation in which there is no binary relation between two concepts, of an expression and its opposite (such as certainty and uncertainty). This is an elusive between-time that cannot be delineated and described in words. As such, it is an enabling time: it enables the mixture of the day that is concluding and the night that is beginning; the simultaneous full existence of both day and night; and the point of transition between day and night, which exists but cannot be held. This state of being is defined in philosophy as \u201cvagueness,\u201d which some believe is epistemic in nature (rooted in our ability to identify a phenomenon), while others see it as related to the phenomenon itself. The creation of these vague, borderline spaces gave rise to uncertainty, which enabled the sages to issue unexpected halakhic rulings, since law usually prefers binary situations. It also created a space for discourse about the vagueness itself and its character. As Professor Halbertal explains, these gave rise to additional and desirable spaces for opportunities for expanding the social structure, and for \u201cbold developments\u201d in halakha, as he puts it.\n\nWritten by Ruth Lehavi\n\n\nCollaborative Governance:\u00a0Theory and Lessons from IsraelEditors: Dr. Neta Sher-Hadar, Dr. Lihi Lahat, and Professor Itzhak GalnoorPalgrave Macmillan (English)\nCollaborative Governance: Theory and Lessons from Israel,\u00a0edited by Mandel faculty member Dr. Neta Sher-Hadar, Dr. Lihi Lahat, and Professor Itzhak Galnoor, contains a collection of studies on collaborative governance \u2013 cooperative efforts involving multiple sectors intended to improve the process of policy design and implementation. These studies are the product of a research group, led by Dr. Sher-Hadar and Dr. Lahat, which operated at the Center for Social Justice and Democracy in Memory of Yaakov Chazan at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute. The group members were drawn from a range of disciplines in both academic research and social and public action, and their joint research combined theory with its translation into practice, and back again into research and theory, while examining arrangements for collaborative governance and their contribution to the advancement of public values and democracy.\nBy examining the Israeli case and the changes that have occurred in recent years in cross-sector collaboration arrangements, the studies identify several factors that influence the ability of such arrangements to successfully promote public values, such as greater trust between government institutions and citizens, access to the public sphere, and equality in the balance of power between the different actors. Concerning the democratic aspects, the mechanisms of collaborative government enable the expression of the values and desires of different stakeholders in the promotion of public values, encourage taking responsibility by all actors involved, and strengthen the structure of democracy. The question remains, however, as to whether these mechanisms also strengthen democratic processes.\nAmong other things, the editors stress that it is not sufficient to have mechanisms for collaboration, which facilitate greater expression for more participants than in the past; rather, it is vital to constantly strengthen the democratic approach in collaborative governance arrangements, for example, by bolstering pluralism, involvement in the political-democratic process, the place of partners from civil society, and the awareness and capabilities of the civil service.\nIn the current age \u2013 in which democratic processes are being weakened while the nature of the relations between central government, local government, and civil society organizations is changing \u2013 it is to be hoped that the book\u2019s conclusions will be considered by leaders seeking to promote public values and democracy in Israel.\nWritten by Ruth Lehavi\n\n\nKauqab \u2013 Trailblazing Bedouin WomenBy Professor Smadar Ben-AsherMofet Institute (Hebrew)\nKauqab, by Professor Smadar Ben-Asher, is a book full of both hope and despair. The truth it uncovers \u2013 the here-and-now reality of Israel in the twenty-first century \u2013 is a world of \u201censlavement.\u201d With a compassionate, empathic, and non-judgmental eye, and a wonderfully sensitive hand, Ben-Asher paints the picture of how various remarkable women cope with this reality. One element of how these women deal with their fate lies within their own consciousness; another lies in their interaction with figures in their immediate circles and beyond who give them hope; and yet another is located in the battleground between them and their oppressors. There is such great hope hidden in the ability of these women, driven by courage and self-belief, to move around the borderlines that are unspoken but clearly felt, to break through them and not retreat. Ben-Asher listens to these women, enables them, moves them forward, encourages them to speak, and gives added meaning to their words.\nHer book is intended to open our eyes and serve as a window and a mirror. It offers a view into a hidden world; it is a mirror that reflects what is inside more than what is outside; and it is a window to a horizon of hope and change. Not too dramatic a change, but a change that is nonetheless visible. A change that can be aspired to and achieved. We learn that every woman has a name, every daughter and sister and mother, every woman who gives birth, feeds her children, clothes them and launders for them, churns milk and bakes bread, and is silent. And we learn that every woman who is beaten has a name, who is turned away, driven out, every woman whose husband marries a second wife, every daughter whose father marries for the third and fourth time.\nKauqab should be translated into Arabic so that Amal (\u201chope\u201d in Arabic, and also the name of one of the book\u2019s heroines) can enter the hearts of the men and women whom Ben-Asher wants to release from their prisons of being. The keys to this release are listening, courage, and tolerance, and perhaps this is a combination of Bedouin forbearance with Ben-Asher\u2019s soft and compassionate approach: another dunam (a measure of land equivalent to approximately 900 square meters), another house, another tree, and another woman freed from enslavement.\n\nWritten by Israel Sorek\n\n\n\nThe Zionist PhantomBy Professor Dana ArieliLimited edition art book, self-published (Hebrew)\nIn this, the last book in her Phantom trilogy (which includes The Nazi Phantom: A Journey After the Relics of the Third Reich, published by Resling in 2014, and Phantom: Journeys After the Relics of Dictatorships, self-published as a limited edition in 2016), Professor Arieli combines two passions: photography and research. The Zionist Phantom presents a photography project that Arieli has been working on for more than a decade. In her travels throughout Israel, Arieli documents mainly memorial sites and spaces (such as monuments and museums about the history of the Jewish people) alongside structures (such as abandoned factories) or disputed sites located at the heart of the Jewish-Arab conflict and which reflect its history.\nArieli\u2019s continuing engagement with ruins and abandoned sites \u2013 or as she calls them, \u201cphantoms\u201d \u2013 dovetails with her strong interest in architectural photography. Alongside these, she researches the interrelations between art and trauma, mainly as expressed in Israel and Germany. In her previous books, and particularly in Romanticism of Steel: Art and Politics in Germany, Arieli sought to map the theoretical path linking art and politics, while in the Phantom trilogy she examines the subjects of her research from a creative perspective. The Zionist Phantom set contains approximately 160 photographs, which can be leafed through like an old-fashioned card index box. It also includes a book containing more than 180 responses from different writers (out of some 600 that were collected on a\u00a0website that was specially designed for the project), and which can be viewed here.\n\nThe content of the books above represents the view of the authors and does not necessarily reflect the view of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel.\n","html_content":"<p>\u200b<img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/new-books-2021.jpg\" alt=\"New Books by Faculty Members of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel\" class=\"img-responsive\"><br><br>Five new books have been added to the publications of Mandel faculty members in the last year.

She also asks why various grassroots pedagogical initiatives, many of which have been successful on a small scale and have created islands of excellence, have been unable to connect to form comprehensive change. For many years now, Professor Zohar has been studying the teaching and learning of higher order thinking and their place in current pedagogical theories. She is closely familiar with the various attempts made over the years to implement innovative pedagogical programs in the Israeli education system, some of which she led herself, and argues that despite such developments, these islands of innovation have not been linked together into a coherent whole. The book takes as a case study the reform advanced by Professor Zohar when she served as chair of the Pedagogical Secretariat at the Education Ministry, which involved a comprehensive effort to implement processes of higher order thinking and deep understanding throughout the education system.<\/p>\n<p>The answer she proposes is to shift the focus of reform from change processes that emphasize structures and administration toward broader and deeper pedagogical processes. Professor Zohar interprets the concept of \u201cpedagogy\u201d as being the essence of teaching and learning, which she believes requires in-depth knowledge gained over many years, encompassing theory, research, and traditions of learning. She reminds readers that at the heart of all activity in schools is the acquisition of deep knowledge and thinking strategies, and thus educational change efforts must include elements of \u201csubstantive pedagogy\u201d that address these elements rather than target mainly administrative elements. Just as the aim of school-based learning is the construction of knowledge and thinking strategies, so the aim of leaders of pedagogical change should be the acquisition of deep knowledge about teaching processes and their implementation \u2013 from the early stages of teacher training, through professional development of teachers, to assessment and the planning and development of curricula.<\/p>\n<p>In one of the book\u2019s central chapters, Professor Zohar encourages educational leaders to be instructional leaders \u2013 that is, pedagical&nbsp;\u2013 and teaching-oriented leaders, who recognize the importance of examining the pedagogical essence of changes, rather than just deciding on the structures of change. This will enable the professionals leading educational change processes to address the deeper goals of teaching and learning in an informed and methodical way, to look for ways to attain these goals, and thus to advance the desired improvement in education in Israel.<br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <em>Written by&nbsp;Ruth Lehavi<\/em><br><\/p>\n<p> \n   <strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/kotar.cet.ac.il\/KotarApp\/Viewer.aspx?nBookID=106256140#10.4905.6.default\" title=\"Read the Table of Contents and Introduction (Hebrew)\" target=\"_blank\"> <\/a>\n<p> \n   <br> \n<\/p>\n<div><div style=\"height:2px;border-bottom:1px solid #a8cfe7;\"><\/div>\n   <br>\n<\/div>\n<p> \n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/books-halbertal.png\" alt=\"The Birth of Doubt\" class=\"img-responsive\" style=\"max-width:200px;\"> \n   <br> \n<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"border-top:none;text-transform:inherit;font-size:18px;color:#006699;\">\n   <strong>The Birth of Doubt: Confronting Uncertainty in Early Rabbinic Literature<\/strong><br>By Professor Moshe Halbertal<br><strong style=\"font-family:&quot;segoe ui&quot;, segoe, tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">Magnes Press (Hebrew)<br><\/strong><strong style=\"text-transform:inherit;font-family:&quot;segoe ui&quot;, segoe, tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">Brown Judaic Studies (English)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In T<em>he Birth of Doubt<\/em>, Professor Moshe Halbertal examines the <em>halakhic<\/em>&nbsp;(legal)&nbsp;rulings of the <em>tanaim<\/em> (the rabbinical sages of the first and second centuries CE), which were formulated in conditions of doubt and uncertainty. The book will also be of interest to readers who are not familiar with early halakhic literature, as the principles that Professor Halbertal proposes for clarifying these rulings are also applicable to the timeless existential need for mediation between the ability to read reality (an ability that is always limited for human beings) and the human desire to operate with certainty in conditions of doubt and to avoid the costs of error they invite.<\/p>\n<p>In a personal conversation about his research, Professor Halbertal spoke about the rabbinical concept of \u201c<em>bein<\/em> <em>hashmashot<\/em>\u201d (twilight, literally \u201cbetween the suns,\u201d which is discussed in chapter 6 of the book. This concept describes a situation in which there is no binary relation between two concepts, of an expression and its opposite (such as certainty and uncertainty). This is an elusive between-time that cannot be delineated and described in words. As such, it is an enabling time: it enables the mixture of the day that is concluding and the night that is beginning; the simultaneous full existence of both day and night; and the point of transition between day and night, which exists but cannot be held. This state of being is defined in philosophy as \u201cvagueness,\u201d which some believe is epistemic in nature (rooted in our ability to identify a phenomenon), while others see it as related to the phenomenon itself. The creation of these vague, borderline spaces gave rise to uncertainty, which enabled the sages to issue unexpected halakhic rulings, since law usually prefers binary situations. It also created a space for discourse about the vagueness itself and its character. As Professor Halbertal explains, these gave rise to additional and desirable spaces for opportunities for expanding the social structure, and for \u201cbold developments\u201d in halakha, as he puts it.<\/p>\n<div> \n   <br> \n<\/div>\n<div> \n   <em>Written by Ruth Lehavi<\/em><br><br><\/div>\n<p>\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<div><div style=\"height:2px;border-bottom:1px solid #a8cfe7;\"><\/div> \n   <br> \n<\/div>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/book-neta-sher-hadar.png\" alt=\"Collaborative Governance: Theory and Lessons from Israel\" class=\"img-responsive\" style=\"max-width:200px;\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"border-top:none;text-transform:inherit;font-size:18px;color:#006699;\"> \n   <strong>Collaborative Governance:&nbsp;Theory and Lessons from Israel<\/strong><br>Editors: Dr. Neta Sher-Hadar, Dr. Lihi Lahat, and Professor Itzhak Galnoor<br><strong style=\"font-family:&quot;segoe ui&quot;, segoe, tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">Palgrave Macmillan (English)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p> \n   <em>Collaborative Governance: Theory and Lessons from Israel<\/em>,&nbsp;edited by Mandel faculty member Dr. Neta Sher-Hadar, Dr. Lihi Lahat, and Professor Itzhak Galnoor, contains a collection of studies on collaborative governance \u2013 cooperative efforts involving multiple sectors intended to improve the process of policy design and implementation. These studies are the product of a research group, led by Dr. Sher-Hadar and Dr. Lahat, which operated at the Center for Social Justice and Democracy in Memory of Yaakov Chazan at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute. The group members were drawn from a range of disciplines in both academic research and social and public action, and their joint research combined theory with its translation into practice, and back again into research and theory, while examining arrangements for collaborative governance and their contribution to the advancement of public values and democracy.<\/p>\n<p>By examining the Israeli case and the changes that have occurred in recent years in cross-sector collaboration arrangements, the studies identify several factors that influence the ability of such arrangements to successfully promote public values, such as greater trust between government institutions and citizens, access to the public sphere, and equality in the balance of power between the different actors. Concerning the democratic aspects, the mechanisms of collaborative government enable the expression of the values and desires of different stakeholders in the promotion of public values, encourage taking responsibility by all actors involved, and strengthen the structure of democracy. The question remains, however, as to whether these mechanisms also strengthen democratic processes.<\/p>\n<p>Among other things, the editors stress that it is not sufficient to have mechanisms for collaboration, which facilitate greater expression for more participants than in the past; rather, it is vital to constantly strengthen the democratic approach in collaborative governance arrangements, for example, by bolstering pluralism, involvement in the political-democratic process, the place of partners from civil society, and the awareness and capabilities of the civil service.<\/p>\n<p>In the current age \u2013 in which democratic processes are being weakened while the nature of the relations between central government, local government, and civil society organizations is changing \u2013 it is to be hoped that the book\u2019s conclusions will be considered by leaders seeking to promote public values and democracy in Israel.<br><\/p>\n<div> \n   <em>Written by Ruth Lehavi<\/em><br><\/div>\n<div> \n   <br> \n   <br> \n<\/div>\n<div><div style=\"height:2px;border-bottom:1px solid #a8cfe7;\"><\/div>\n   <br>\n<\/div>\n<p> \n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/book-smadar-ben-asher.png\" alt=\"Kauqab \u2013 Trailblazing Bedouin Women\" class=\"img-responsive\" style=\"max-width:200px;\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"border-top:none;text-transform:inherit;font-size:18px;color:#006699;\"> \n   <strong>Kauqab \u2013 Trailblazing Bedouin Women<\/strong><br>By Professor Smadar Ben-Asher<br><strong style=\"font-family:&quot;segoe ui&quot;, segoe, tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">Mofet Institute (Hebrew)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p> \n   <em>Kauqab<\/em>, by Professor Smadar Ben-Asher, is a book full of both hope and despair. The truth it uncovers \u2013 the here-and-now reality of Israel in the twenty-first century \u2013 is a world of \u201censlavement.\u201d With a compassionate, empathic, and non-judgmental eye, and a wonderfully sensitive hand, Ben-Asher paints the picture of how various remarkable women cope with this reality. One element of how these women deal with their fate lies within their own consciousness; another lies in their interaction with figures in their immediate circles and beyond who give them hope; and yet another is located in the battleground between them and their oppressors. There is such great hope hidden in the ability of these women, driven by courage and self-belief, to move around the borderlines that are unspoken but clearly felt, to break through them and not retreat. Ben-Asher listens to these women, enables them, moves them forward, encourages them to speak, and gives added meaning to their words.<\/p>\n<p>Her book is intended to open our eyes and serve as a window and a mirror. It offers a view into a hidden world; it is a mirror that reflects what is inside more than what is outside; and it is a window to a horizon of hope and change. Not too dramatic a change, but a change that is nonetheless visible. A change that can be aspired to and achieved. We learn that every woman has a name, every daughter and sister and mother, every woman who gives birth, feeds her children, clothes them and launders for them, churns milk and bakes bread, and is silent. And we learn that every woman who is beaten has a name, who is turned away, driven out, every woman whose husband marries a second wife, every daughter whose father marries for the third and fourth time.<\/p>\n<p>Kauqab should be translated into Arabic so that Amal (\u201chope\u201d in Arabic, and also the name of one of the book\u2019s heroines) can enter the hearts of the men and women whom Ben-Asher wants to release from their prisons of being. The keys to this release are listening, courage, and tolerance, and perhaps this is a combination of Bedouin forbearance with Ben-Asher\u2019s soft and compassionate approach: another dunam (a measure of land equivalent to approximately 900 square meters), another house, another tree, and another woman freed from enslavement.<\/p>\n<div> \n   <br> \n<\/div>\n<div> \n   <em>Written by Israel Sorek<\/em><br><\/div>\n<p> \n   <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t1yUZKtECJA&amp;t=5s&amp;ab_channel=TAUVOD\" title=\"Watch the Tel Aviv University conference that marked the book\u2019s publication (Hebrew)\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><\/strong><\/a><br><\/p>\n<div><div style=\"height:2px;border-bottom:1px solid #a8cfe7;\"><\/div> \n   <br> \n<\/div>\n<p> \n   <br> \n<\/p>\n<p> \n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/book-dana-arieli.png\" alt=\"The Zionist Phantom\" class=\"img-responsive\" style=\"max-width:200px;\"> \n   <br> \n<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"border-top:none;text-transform:inherit;font-size:18px;color:#006699;\"> \n   <strong>The Zionist Phantom<\/strong><br>By Professor Dana Arieli<br><strong style=\"font-family:&quot;segoe ui&quot;, segoe, tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">Limited edition art book, self-published (Hebrew)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In this, the last book in her \n   <em>Phantom<\/em> trilogy (which includes<em> The Nazi Phantom: A Journey After the Relics of the Third Reich<\/em>, published by Resling in 2014, and \n   <em>Phantom: Journeys After the Relics of Dictatorships<\/em>, self-published as a limited edition in 2016), Professor Arieli combines two passions: photography and research. \n   <em>The Zionist Phantom<\/em> presents a photography project that Arieli has been working on for more than a decade.

Planned by landscape architect Leor Lovinger and the building's architects in consultation with Amir Balaban, head of the department of urban nature of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel (SPNI), the Mandel Foundation\u2019s living roof enables the building to preserve the continuity of the green and wooded land of the valley\u00a0in which it is located, continuing the urban ecological corridor in which the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens and the Gazelle Park are located.\n\n\nUnlike many living roofs, the Mandel Foundation\u2019s roof does not have an automatic watering system; rather, it is designed to mimic nature, growing in accordance with the seasons of the year and the natural cycle of rainfall. It is thus considered a \u201cbrown roof\u201d rather than a \u201cgreen roof,\u201d since it is only green for part of the year. Spanning two and a half dunam (about half an acre), the Mandel roof is Israel\u2019s largest living roof and the largest living roof of its type in the Middle East. In the winter, after the soil absorbs rain water, the roof bursts into bloom and is covered in beautiful Mediterranean plant life, which continues to bloom throughout the spring. During the summer, when there is no rain and no irrigation, the plants wither and the roof is covered in gold and brown, like the natural areas surrounding it.\n\nDuring the building\u2019s construction, the roof was specially sealed to ensure that no water would leak into the building. Next, special mats were laid out, and a layer of 10-20 cm of terra rossa (red clay soil) was placed over them. Planting of more than 60 types of plants followed, including over 2,000 squill bulbs (known as \u201cchatzav\u201d in Hebrew), 700 anemones, 500 buttercups, 600 bulbs of garlic, 200 cyclamen bulbs, and more. An additional 40 types of plants, such as the wheat that can be seen on roof in the summer, grew from seeds that were in the soil itself. Bird droppings were responsible for tens of additional plants.\n\nThe roof is home not only to thousands of flowers but to a variety of wildlife. It is populated by thousands of invertebrates and hosts pollinating insects, bees, and butterflies. Many species of birds are attracted to the roof and its abundance of food, and move around it freely without any human interference. Even in the summer, when Israel is completely dry, the building\u2019s roof is thriving with life.\n\nIt should be noted that the living roof was relatively inexpensive to set up, has minimal infrastructure, has no maintenance costs, and serves as a layer of insulation that conserves energy and decreases cooling costs in the summer. The roof also helps absorb runoff water. The high silt content in its soil enables it to absorb up to 140 cubic feet of water, demonstrating the potential of living roofs to be part of a city\u2019s water management system and to help prevent flooding in urban areas. Rather than running off into the streets, the water is used by plants, which also absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.\nThe Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel monitors what takes place on the Mandel living roof and uses it as an example to encourage the construction of living roofs on municipal and public buildings in Israel. The Mandel Foundation is proud to be a pioneer of this kind of environmental protection in Israel, to have its headquarters in Jerusalem serve as a model of how buildings can compensate for the loss of nature in urban environments, and to be part of national and international efforts to contribute to biodiversity conservation.\n\n","html_content":"<p> \n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/MFI-roof.jpg\" alt=\"The Mandel Foundation's Living Roof\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\"> (Photo: Shlomi Amsalem)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\"><\/span><font color=\"#777777\"><br><\/font>The Mandel Foundation\u2019s new building in Jerusalem is an elegant two-story structure that blends in with its surroundings, thanks in part to a \u201cliving roof\u201d that contributes to urban bio diversity and serves as a home to thousands of flowers and a variety of wildlife.

During this year-long process, the fellows immerse themselves in key issues and challenges facing the Negev. As part of this process, they formulate their vision and translate it into action in the form of innovative initiatives in the cultural arena.\u00a0\nThe practical component is an essential part of the program\u2019s theory of change, which sees developing sustainable cultural life that is adapted to Negev society as vital for improving quality of life in the region, which is home to much artistic and cultural activity. The program's theory of change also believes that developing cultural leadership will contribute to the preservation of tradition and identities and will enrich local identity, which in turn will strengthen the uniqueness of the Negev and strengthen ties to the region.\nLed by program director Professor Dana Arieli and faculty member Dr. Itzhak (Kiki) Aharonovich, the process of developing personal projects includes individual and group mentoring from a multidisciplinary team of experts, drawn from the fields of visual culture, community, education, art, curation, sociology, and research. The graduates of Cohort 2 have\u00a0presented their projects on a dedicated Hebrew website, produced under the direction of senior staff member Hadas Kedar, which presents the fruits of their labor under the banner \"Dreaming Culture in the Negev.\"\u00a0\nAs can be seen in the examples that follow, the projects all relate to challenges in the places and spaces in which the graduates operate. Creating new cultural initiatives provided fellows with practical experience in designing vision-based and research-driven leadership initiatives aimed at actual implementation in the field and bringing about real-world change.\nYogev Vanounou, one of the founders of the Negev Artists\u2019 House, developed a project that aims to foster artistic creation in the city\u00a0of Beer Sheva by cultivating local plastic artists and providing art classes. He also seeks to promote municipal policy change in collaboration with the municipal planning department. Under Yogev\u2019s leadership, a range of cultural activities are already taking place under the auspices of the Beer Sheva municipality, as a response to the lack of art and culture during the coronavirus pandemic. Recently, he won a tender for the operation of the municipality\u2019s activities in this realm, which will enable him to start running activities on an ongoing basis starting in June 2021.\u00a0\nTamar Herzberg, head of pedagogy at the From Holocaust to Revival Museum in Kibbutz Yad Mordechai, developed a project for integrating members of the Arab-Bedouin community into the staff of the museum by training them to serve as guides. The training program is part of a broader vision for promoting meaningful Jewish-Arab dialogue. It is based on the idea that the traumatic memories of the Arab and Jewish populations of the Negev are formative and influential memories that can promote dialogue based on empathy rather than anxiety. Tamar developed the training course in collaboration with A New Dawn in the Negev, a non-profit organization that works to promote Bedouin-Jewish coexistence and is headed by Jamal Alkirnawi, a graduate of the first cohort of the Mandel Program for Cultural Leadership in the Negev. The first group of Arab-Bedouin guides completed their training in February 2021 and began leading tours of the museum in Hebrew and Arabic as part of the museum\u2019s ongoing activities. Preparations are currently underway for the second cohort of the training program.\nEman Abu Galion, a teacher and social entrepreneur, developed an initiative that aims to use the traditional Bedouin tent as an educational and cultural space through which the younger generation can connect with Bedouin heritage. She envisions the tent as serving students, teachers, and the community as a place of learning about their heritage that will also be a peaceful corner for discussing feelings, having intergenerational and multicultural encounters, and transmitting Bedouin values such as respect, acceptance of others, and hospitality. This, in her vision, will build a connection between past and present in Bedouin society.\n\nNadav Mishali, founder of the Ofakim Cinematheque, planned an initiative that seeks to establish a new tier of activity\u00a0at the Cinematheque that would conduct educational, visual, and multicultural activities for children and youth in Ofakim and the entire Western Negev region. Nadav aims to introduce children and youth to cinema as a tool for heightening their ability to express themselves.\u00a0He will do this by establishing an informal educational framework for activities in a variety of fields related to cinema. These will include workshops for creating films, for critical viewing of films, and more. Nadav\u2019s project is being conducted in collaboration with the Western Negev Cluster, and a film that he is directing with Miriam Ben Gigi, based on a screenplay that they wrote together, will soon be released.\n\nUvit Kabada, who facilitates parents groups for Fidel, a non-profit organization that aims to integrate Ethiopian Israelis fully into Israeli society, planned an initiative whose aim is to document and preserve the story of the Ethiopian community in Israel and to develop connections between Ethiopian culture and Israeli-Western culture. Uvit seeks to establish a center that will include workshops that will generate encounters with multiple forms of Ethiopian culture: traditional garb, food, crafts and games. She envisions the center not as a memorial to the past but as a living hub that will include a variety of activities intended for diverse types of visitors.\n\nAviva Freedman, an architect and social activist, planned a regional art center that will be established in the Sha'ar Hanegev Regional Council. The center will be built on an open plot of land near an immigrant absorption center, centrally located opposite the city of Sderot and Sapir College. Her project aims to make alternative culture available in this rural area, and to expose the varied population groups in this area to various\u00a0forms of art.\n\nThe graduates of Cohort 2, who have now joined the graduates of Cohort 1, are part of a growing community of leaders in the field of arts and culture in the Negev. The Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev is currently training the program\u2019s third cohort, and will be training a fourth cohort in 2021-2022.\nIt is our hope that the initiatives of the fellows and graduates of the Mandel Program for Cultural Leadership in Negev will form the basis for action that will result in positive change and\u00a0 advances in the realm of culture in the Negev. We are confident that the graduates will have the courage and endurance to continue turning dreams into reality, and to lead bold and groundbreaking initiatives for the benefit of society in the Negev \u2013 initiatives that will create a society that is stronger and more ethical, and that has greater fortitude.\nClick here to visit\u00a0the \u201cDreaming Culture in the Negev\u201d website (Hebrew) >>\n","html_content":"<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Negev-Culture-Minisite-2.jpg\" alt=\"Cohort 2 of the Mandel Program for Cultural Leadership in the Negev\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Graduates of&nbsp;Cohort 2 of the&nbsp;Mandel Program for Cultural Leadership in the Negev<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>\u200bAs part of the practical component of their studies, fellows of the Mandel Program for Cultural Leadership in the Negev gain experience in research and practice in their field by planning and developing an individual&nbsp;project.

The book calls on us, as did Alterman in his poems, to listen to the music of the world, music whose melody is independent of man but can be responsive to him, if only he opens himself up to its \"vital presence.\"\u00a0\nWhat is vital presence? In \u201cA Brief Comment on Music and Haste,\u201d which Professor Hirschfeld incorporates in the book as an additional reflection, he writes: \u201cListening to Alterman's poems or to their lyrical renditions differs from the attention we exercise when listening to ordinary words or events. This is because the \"music of the world\" is present in these poems, and through them we listen to it\u2026 or to the rhythm in every act of life, which generates breathing, hunger, thirst, the movement of walking, sunrise and sunset, and more\u201d (pp. 154\u2013155).\u00a0\nVital presence, says Professor Hirschfeld, is man\u2019s essence; it is his poetry, found in the power of his emotions and their expression. But more than in words, the real way of joining in with the \u201cmusic of the world\u201d is \u201cIn the Melody of Silence\u201d (the last poem in Alterman's Stars Outside) \u2013 that is, in a silence that creates the deep attention necessary for a person to be able to connect to the great melody of creation.\nProfessor Hirschfeld\u2019s re-reading of the poems in Alterman\u2019s Stars Outside is not merely a literary analysis of Alterman\u2019s poetry. It also provides readers with tools to create a calm inner space that is attentive to the music that they have within themselves and that can be found in the world.\n\nRead the Table of Contents and Introduction (Hebrew) >>\n\n\nThe Return to Al-Andalus: Disputes over Sephardic Culture and Identity between Arabic and HebrewBy Yuval EvriMagnes Press\nDr. Yuval Evri\u2019s new book traces contested visions and representations of al-Andalus\/Sepharad among modern Jews through a close analysis of the work of Sephardic intellectuals in the\u00a0Land of Israel\/Palestine and their networks at the turn of the twentieth century. Prominent among them were Abraham Shalom Yahuda (1877\u20131951), Abraham Elmaleh (1885\u20131967), Yosef Meyouhas (1868\u20131942), Nissim Malul (1892\u20131959) and Yitzhak Benyamin Yahuda (1863\u20131941), who formed part of a growing circle of Sephardi local scholars engaged in a variety of intellectual activities: translation, literary interpretation, journalism, lexicography, philology, and education.\nAs active members in both Hebrew and Arabic revival movements (Haskalah and Nahda respectively) during the late Ottoman Era, they operated within a range of conflicting political and ideological affinities: they were committed to the emerging national monolingual Jewish project, identified with the Ottoman political reformation and the ethos of the shared homeland, and they emphasized their affiliation with the Arab revival movement and the joint historical legacy of Judeo-Muslim and Judeo-Arabic culture. Furthermore, their work developed in relation and as a reaction to the emergence of the Hebrew and Arabic national cultural movements.\u00a0\nAmong themselves and with their European Jewish counterparts, they discussed how to research and represent the cultural heritage of Sepharad on their own terms rather than as part of Jewish cultural visions and political struggles in Europe. They debated how the modern Jewish cultural and national renewal in Palestine should relate to the Arabic language, Arab society, and the Ottoman state, and asked how native Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews and new European Jewish immigrants should arrange themselves with each other under the British Mandate.\nThe book explores disputes over Sephardic culture and identity between Arabic and Hebrew, not in order to examine how they were settled, but to understand through them the many manifestations of \u201cSephardism\u201d and how it has been interpreted in various contexts: in texts, ideas, people, traditions, times, and places. The book also examines the ways in which local Sephardic intellectuals challenged the nationalistic and monolingual separatist ideologies that characterized their times, and proposed an alternative political and cultural route. It looks at their efforts to establish a shared Jewish-Arab society based on a symbolic return to the Sephardi\/Andalusian medieval legacy of Hebrew-Arabic bilingualism and a Judeo-Muslim joint cultural heritage.\u00a0\nDr. Evri illustrates the connection that could have been made by expanding the internal Jewish-Sephardi disputes to include discourse on the \u201cArab question\u201d via the story of Abraham Shalom Yahuda (the subject of Dr. Evri\u2019s previous research), who was one of the most important Jewish intellectuals born and raised in Jerusalem, but who did not find his place there (this is the focus of the book\u2019s second chapter).\u00a0\nOne of the key themes of the book is missed opportunity \u2013 a missed opportunity to cultivate better co-existence with the Palestinians, a missed opportunity to create better relations between Israel\u2019s ethnic communities than those that have developed since the establishment of the State of Israel, and more. Dr. Evri does not point a finger of blame at those who might have been responsible for the resulting situation; rather, he recommends re-examining the situation, transcending familiar disciplinary boundaries, and trying to imagine alternative realities.\nBy exploring these debates and these contested representations of Andalusian identity and culture, the book re-examines some fundamental issues that emerged at the turn of the twentieth century: the national conflict between Jews and Palestinians, the contacts and splits between Hebrew and Arab cultures and the ethnic power relations between Ashkenazim and Mizrahim.\nRead the table of contents and introduction (Hebrew) >>\nWatch Yuval Evri talking about the book in an Oxford University podcast (English) >>\n\n\nThe Days of the TanzimA Play by Ayman AgbariaMaktoob, The Van Leer Jerusalem Institute\nThis play by Dr. Ayman Agbaria tells the story of a woman and two men who are connected in different and complicated ways: by family ties, unrequited love, a joint land deal, and as people who were founders of the Tanzim Party several decades earlier. Their memories of the past evoke a longing for a seemingly simpler world. As these memories are interwoven with contemporary reality, we become aware of the tension that exists between the three friends, which stems from what each remembers, how the memories are related to their dreams, and how the memories affect the role that each friend expects and is expected to play in the lives of the others.\nDr. Agbaria does not allow the characters he created to bask in the sweetness of their shared and \u201csimple\u201d memories. Clinging to old memories cannot provide fertile ground for the development of new realities that can correct the damage done to each of the characters, and within Palestinian society as a whole. \u201cWho can photograph your heart, your memory, and your dreams?\u201d argues Younes,\u00a0 challenging Musa, his longtime friend and admirer, who is deeply immersed in the political intrigues and power games of his run for mayor.\nThe complicated Palestinian reality requires a different view, for, as Younes says: \u201cNow, the situation is different. Things are mixed up \u2013 truth is confused with lies, treason with nationalism, faith with heresy. I know nothing anymore. I no longer know you nor myself\u201d (p. 27).\nNevertheless, this is not a story of total identity loss. Faced with the disillusionment and despair that stems from the recognition that the three friends do not have a common future, the characters quote verses from the Koran and the Hadiths throughout the play, and incorporate folk tales and works from past and contemporary Muslim and Palestinian culture (including a play within the play).\nThe common past and shared culture of the friends are present despite a sense of disintegration. The friends are all victims of their principles, conclude the two friends who remain at the end of the play, after the death of the third. The conclusion that \"we are all victims\" conveys a moral of a traditional kind: \u201cAl-Khira fima ach\u2019tarahu Allah \u2013 everything is for the best.\u201d Despite this conclusion, the play does not have a totalistic or fatalistic worldview. \u201cEverything is for the best\u201d is also the moral of a story told by the two friends at the start of the play \u2013 a parable in which the subject of the comparison remains open. Repeating this moral at the end of the play raises a question and perhaps a call to action: Will the friends re-examine the parable and interpret it?\nThe play was published in an Arabic-Hebrew edition by the Van Leer Institute\u2019s Maktoob imprint. It has been performed by the Jaffa Theatre in a production starring Makram Khoury, Rauda Suleiman, and Yosef Abu Varda (who also directs).\nRead the play in Hebrew and Arabic >>\n\n\nStudents of Yesterday, Students of Tomorrow: Three Waves of Reform in the World of EducationBy Ami VolanskySchocken Books\nProfessor Ami Volansky proposes seeing the inherent gap between expectations from education systems (both in Israel and the world) and the ability to fulfill them, as the explanation for the constant search for changes in educational methods. This reading refrains from passing judgment on the factors that cause the gap between expectations and a reality that can never be fully predicted, but does not despair of overcoming this gap. In his review, Professor Volansky seeks to shed light on the conceptions behind various reforms and examines whether the considerations applied by those who planned and implemented reforms in the education system indeed reflect these conceptions.\nThe answer to this question can explain the success or failure of the various reforms discussed in this book. For example, in describing the background of the third and current wave of educational reforms, which focus on meaningful learning, Professor Volansky refers to the symbiosis between the world of youth and technology in the education system and the many efforts that have been made in order to promote technology in education since the 1970s, and today more than ever (pp. 142\u2013137, Vol. II).\nProfessor Volansky\u2019s description of the systemic behavior is fairly consistent. A need is identified (e.g., access to knowledge outside the classroom and school, students at the center of knowledge production, adaptation to the constructivist approach, peer learning, self-study, etc.). Next, a budget is allocated and a direct response is provided (e.g., computers are purchased for classrooms). Following this, a (not surprising) gap is revealed between the \u201csolution\u201d and the ability to make intelligent educational use of it. It then emerges that the need has not been met, and a committee is set up (e.g., the 1990 Harari Committee) and is tasked with recommending solutions to improve the response and properly implement it within the education system. Consequently, there is vibrant educational activity, and many research initiatives are launched.\nHowever, Professor Volansky asks, has the educational goal of meaningful learning been achieved? In the case of incorporating new technology into the education system, were the appropriate \u201cbig\u201d questions asked, such as: \u201cHas the teaching and learning culture of the education system changed? Has traditional teaching culture changed? Is learning more active today? Is the learner more independent? Do teachers benefit from greater autonomy?\" As this example shows, these questions are always relevant.\nWatch the Tel Aviv University conference that marked the book\u2019s publication (Hebrew) >>\n\n\nThe Founding Father: Chaim Weizmann, Biography, 1922\u20131952By Motti Golani and\u00a0Jehuda ReinharzAm Oved Publishing\nTheodore Herzl was the visionary who foresaw the State of Israel. No one disputes that. But the state also had a founding father, Chaim Weizmann, whose name has been forgotten, and whose crown was placed on the head of another: David Ben-Gurion. Had it not been for Chaim Weizmann, Herzl might have been remembered only as a journalist and playwright, and Ben-Gurion would never have become \u201cBen-Gurion.\u201d\nWeizmann, who turned the vision of the State of Israel into a reality, was a man of contradictions. He had mesmerizing charisma but low self-confidence. He was a wonderful conversationalist but a poor public speaker. He was alienated from Eastern European Jewry but willing to give his life for it. He was a people person and a ladies' man, but was always Vera\u2019s partner, for better or worse. He was a hypochondriac who also knew real sickness. He was British to the core and at the same time was an uncompromising Zionist. And, in particular, he was a man who struggled to live in the land in which the country of his dreams had been established.\u00a0\nWeizmann showed that the most effective action for the Zionist enterprise would best be carried out in London or New York, rather than in Jerusalem. After sacrificing his scientific career, his family, and his health for the most important matter in his life, Weizmann came to the State of Israel in body, but perhaps not in soul. The Israeli collective memory never forgave him and remembers him as the first, but powerless, president. This book by\u00a0Professor Motti Golani, faculty member of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, and\u00a0Professor Jehuda Reinharz, President of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation, reveals Weizmann in all his human complexity.\nRead the foreword on the e-vrit website (Hebrew) >>\u00a0\nWatch the Chaim Weizmann Institute's book launch (Hebrew) >>\n\nThe content of the books above represents the view of the authors and does not necessarily reflect the view of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel.\n","html_content":"<p>\u200b<img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Newsletter-books-n.jpg\" alt=\"Mandel faculty books\" class=\"img-responsive\"><br><br>An impressive crop of books written by members of the faculty of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership has recently been published by assorted publishers in Israel: \n   <em>The Stars Vindicated<\/em>, a re-reading of Alterman\u2019s poetry by Professor Ariel Hirschfeld and Professor Dan Miron; \n   <em>The Return to Al-Andalus<\/em>, by Dr. Yuval Evri; \n   <em>The Days of the Tanzim<\/em>, a play by Dr. Ayman Agbaria; and \n   <em>Students of Yesterday, Students of Tomorrow<\/em>, a book by Professor Ami Wolansky.

But more than in words, the real way of joining in with the \u201cmusic of the world\u201d is \u201cIn the Melody of Silence\u201d (the last poem in Alterman's Stars Outside) \u2013 that is, in a silence that creates the deep attention necessary for a person to be able to connect to the great melody of creation.<\/p>\n<p>Professor Hirschfeld\u2019s re-reading of the poems in Alterman\u2019s Stars Outside is not merely a literary analysis of Alterman\u2019s poetry. It also provides readers with tools to create a calm inner space that is attentive to the music that they have within themselves and that can be found in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\n   <strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/kotar.cet.ac.il\/KotarApp\/Viewer.aspx?nBookID=106256140#10.4905.6.default\" title=\"Read the Table of Contents and Introduction (Hebrew)\" target=\"_blank\">\n   <p>\n      <strong>Read the Table of Contents and Introduction (Hebrew) &gt;&gt;<\/strong><br><\/p><\/a>\n<p>\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<div><div style=\"height:2px;border-bottom:1px solid #a8cfe7;\"><\/div> \n   <br> \n<\/div>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Yuval-Evri-book.png\" alt=\"The Return to Al-Andalus\" style=\"max-width:200px;\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"border-top:none;text-transform:inherit;font-size:18px;color:#006699;\">\n   <strong>The Return to Al-Andalus: Disputes over Sephardic Culture and Identity between Arabic and Hebrew<\/strong><br>By Yuval Evri<br><strong style=\"font-family:&quot;segoe ui&quot;, segoe, tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">Magnes Press<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Dr. Yuval Evri\u2019s new book traces contested visions and representations of al-Andalus\/Sepharad among modern Jews through a close analysis of the work of Sephardic intellectuals in the&nbsp;Land of Israel\/Palestine and their networks at the turn of the twentieth century. Prominent among them were Abraham Shalom Yahuda (1877\u20131951), Abraham Elmaleh (1885\u20131967), Yosef Meyouhas (1868\u20131942), Nissim Malul (1892\u20131959) and Yitzhak Benyamin Yahuda (1863\u20131941), who formed part of a growing circle of Sephardi local scholars engaged in a variety of intellectual activities: translation, literary interpretation, journalism, lexicography, philology, and education.<\/p>\n<p>As active members in both Hebrew and Arabic revival movements (Haskalah and Nahda respectively) during the late Ottoman Era, they operated within a range of conflicting political and ideological affinities: they were committed to the emerging national monolingual Jewish project, identified with the Ottoman political reformation and the ethos of the shared homeland, and they emphasized their affiliation with the Arab revival movement and the joint historical legacy of Judeo-Muslim and Judeo-Arabic culture. Furthermore, their work developed in relation and as a reaction to the emergence of the Hebrew and Arabic national cultural movements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Among themselves and with their European Jewish counterparts, they discussed how to research and represent the cultural heritage of Sepharad on their own terms rather than as part of Jewish cultural visions and political struggles in Europe. They debated how the modern Jewish cultural and national renewal in Palestine should relate to the Arabic language, Arab society, and the Ottoman state, and asked how native Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews and new European Jewish immigrants should arrange themselves with each other under the British Mandate.<\/p>\n<p>The book explores disputes over Sephardic culture and identity between Arabic and Hebrew, not in order to examine how they were settled, but to understand through them the many manifestations of \u201cSephardism\u201d and how it has been interpreted in various contexts: in texts, ideas, people, traditions, times, and places. The book also examines the ways in which local Sephardic intellectuals challenged the nationalistic and monolingual separatist ideologies that characterized their times, and proposed an alternative political and cultural route. It looks at their efforts to establish a shared Jewish-Arab society based on a symbolic return to the Sephardi\/Andalusian medieval legacy of Hebrew-Arabic bilingualism and a Judeo-Muslim joint cultural heritage.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Evri illustrates the connection that could have been made by expanding the internal Jewish-Sephardi disputes to include discourse on the \u201cArab question\u201d via the story of Abraham Shalom Yahuda (the subject of Dr. Evri\u2019s previous research), who was one of the most important Jewish intellectuals born and raised in Jerusalem, but who did not find his place there (this is the focus of the book\u2019s second chapter).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One of the key themes of the book is missed opportunity \u2013 a missed opportunity to cultivate better co-existence with the Palestinians, a missed opportunity to create better relations between Israel\u2019s ethnic communities than those that have developed since the establishment of the State of Israel, and more. Dr. Evri does not point a finger of blame at those who might have been responsible for the resulting situation; rather, he recommends re-examining the situation, transcending familiar disciplinary boundaries, and trying to imagine alternative realities.<\/p>\n<p>By exploring these debates and these contested representations of Andalusian identity and culture, the book re-examines some fundamental issues that emerged at the turn of the twentieth century: the national conflict between Jews and Palestinians, the contacts and splits between Hebrew and Arab cultures and the ethnic power relations between Ashkenazim and Mizrahim.<\/p>\n<p>\n   <a href=\"https:\/\/www.magnespress.co.il\/api\/magnes\/book\/6054\/preview\" title=\"Read the table of contents and introduction (Hebrew) >>\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read the table of contents and introduction (Hebrew) &gt;&gt;<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\n   <a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.ox.ac.uk\/reconsidering-early-jewish-nationalist-ideologies-seminar-yuval-evri-kcl-return-al-andalus\" title=\"Watch Yuval Evri talking about the book in an Oxford University podcast (English)\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Watch Yuval Evri talking about the book in an Oxford University podcast (English) &gt;&gt;<\/strong><\/a><br><\/p>\n<p> \n   <br> \n<\/p>\n<div><div style=\"height:2px;border-bottom:1px solid #a8cfe7;\"><\/div>\n   <br>\n<\/div>\n<p> \n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Ayman-play.png\" alt=\"The Days of the Tanzim\" style=\"max-width:200px;\"> \n   <br> \n<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"border-top:none;text-transform:inherit;font-size:18px;color:#006699;\"> \n   <strong>The Days of the Tanzim<\/strong><br>A Play by Ayman Agbaria<br><strong style=\"font-family:&quot;segoe ui&quot;, segoe, tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">Maktoob, The Van Leer Jerusalem Institute<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This play by Dr. Ayman Agbaria tells the story of a woman and two men who are connected in different and complicated ways: by family ties, unrequited love, a joint land deal, and as people who were founders of the Tanzim Party several decades earlier. Their memories of the past evoke a longing for a seemingly simpler world. As these memories are interwoven with contemporary reality, we become aware of the tension that exists between the three friends, which stems from what each remembers, how the memories are related to their dreams, and how the memories affect the role that each friend expects and is expected to play in the lives of the others.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Agbaria does not allow the characters he created to bask in the sweetness of their shared and \u201csimple\u201d memories. Clinging to old memories cannot provide fertile ground for the development of new realities that can correct the damage done to each of the characters, and within Palestinian society as a whole. \u201cWho can photograph your heart, your memory, and your dreams?\u201d argues Younes,&nbsp; challenging Musa, his longtime friend and admirer, who is deeply immersed in the political intrigues and power games of his run for mayor.<\/p>\n<p>The complicated Palestinian reality requires a different view, for, as Younes says: \u201cNow, the situation is different. Things are mixed up \u2013 truth is confused with lies, treason with nationalism, faith with heresy. I know nothing anymore. I no longer know you nor myself\u201d (p. 27).<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, this is not a story of total identity loss. Faced with the disillusionment and despair that stems from the recognition that the three friends do not have a common future, the characters quote verses from the Koran and the Hadiths throughout the play, and incorporate folk tales and works from past and contemporary Muslim and Palestinian culture (including a play within the play).<\/p>\n<p>The common past and shared culture of the friends are present despite a sense of disintegration. The friends are all victims of their principles, conclude the two friends who remain at the end of the play, after the death of the third. The conclusion that \"we are all victims\" conveys a moral of a traditional kind: \u201cAl-Khira fima ach\u2019tarahu Allah \u2013 everything is for the best.\u201d Despite this conclusion, the play does not have a totalistic or fatalistic worldview. \u201cEverything is for the best\u201d is also the moral of a story told by the two friends at the start of the play \u2013 a parable in which the subject of the comparison remains open. Repeating this moral at the end of the play raises a question and perhaps a call to action: Will the friends re-examine the parable and interpret it?<\/p>\n<p>The play was published in an Arabic-Hebrew edition by the Van Leer Institute\u2019s Maktoob imprint. It has been performed by the Jaffa Theatre in a production starring Makram Khoury, Rauda Suleiman, and Yosef Abu Varda (who also directs).<\/p>\n<p>\n   <a href=\"https:\/\/maktoobooks.com\/\u05d9\u05de\u05d9-\u05d4\u05ea\u05e0\u05d6\u05d9\u05dd-\u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645-\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0646\u0638\u064a\u0645\" title=\"Read the play in Hebrew and Arabic >>\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read the play in Hebrew and Arabic &gt;&gt;<\/strong><\/a><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<div><div style=\"height:2px;border-bottom:1px solid #a8cfe7;\"><\/div> \n   <br> \n<\/div>\n<p> \n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Volansky-Book.png\" alt=\"Students of Yesterday, Students of Tomorrow\" style=\"max-width:200px;\"> \n   <br> \n<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"border-top:none;text-transform:inherit;font-size:18px;color:#006699;\"> \n   <strong>Students of Yesterday, Students of Tomorrow: Three Waves of Reform in the World of Education<\/strong><br>By Ami Volansky<br><strong style=\"font-family:&quot;segoe ui&quot;, segoe, tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">Schocken Books<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Professor Ami Volansky proposes seeing the inherent gap between expectations from education systems (both in Israel and the world) and the ability to fulfill them, as the explanation for the constant search for changes in educational methods. This reading refrains from passing judgment on the factors that cause the gap between expectations and a reality that can never be fully predicted, but does not despair of overcoming this gap. In his review, Professor Volansky seeks to shed light on the conceptions behind various reforms and examines whether the considerations applied by those who planned and implemented reforms in the education system indeed reflect these conceptions.<\/p>\n<p>The answer to this question can explain the success or failure of the various reforms discussed in this book. For example, in describing the background of the third and current wave of educational reforms, which focus on meaningful learning, Professor Volansky refers to the symbiosis between the world of youth and technology in the education system and the many efforts that have been made in order to promote technology in education since the 1970s, and today more than ever (pp. 142\u2013137, Vol. II).<\/p>\n<p>Professor Volansky\u2019s description of the systemic behavior is fairly consistent. A need is identified (e.g., access to knowledge outside the classroom and school, students at the center of knowledge production, adaptation to the constructivist approach, peer learning, self-study, etc.). Next, a budget is allocated and a direct response is provided (e.g., computers are purchased for classrooms). Following this, a (not surprising) gap is revealed between the \u201csolution\u201d and the ability to make intelligent educational use of it. It then emerges that the need has not been met, and a committee is set up (e.g., the 1990 Harari Committee) and is tasked with recommending solutions to improve the response and properly implement it within the education system. Consequently, there is vibrant educational activity, and many research initiatives are launched.<\/p>\n<p>However, Professor Volansky asks, has the educational goal of meaningful learning been achieved? In the case of incorporating new technology into the education system, were the appropriate \u201cbig\u201d questions asked, such as: \u201cHas the teaching and learning culture of the education system changed? Has traditional teaching culture changed? Is learning more active today? Is the learner more independent? Do teachers benefit from greater autonomy?\" As this example shows, these questions are always relevant.<\/p>\n<p>\n   <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t1yUZKtECJA&amp;t=5s&amp;ab_channel=TAUVOD\" title=\"Watch the Tel Aviv University conference that marked the book\u2019s publication (Hebrew)\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Watch the Tel Aviv University conference that marked the book\u2019s publication (Hebrew) &gt;&gt;<\/strong><\/a><br><\/p>\n<div><div style=\"height:2px;border-bottom:1px solid #a8cfe7;\"><\/div>\n   <br>\n<\/div>\n<p>\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Golani-Reinharz-book.png\" alt=\"The Founding Father: Chaim Weizmann, Biography, 1922\u20131952\" style=\"max-width:200px;\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"border-top:none;text-transform:inherit;font-size:18px;color:#006699;\">\n   <strong>The Founding Father: Chaim Weizmann, Biography, 1922\u20131952<\/strong><br>By Motti Golani and&nbsp;Jehuda Reinharz<br><strong style=\"font-family:&quot;segoe ui&quot;, segoe, tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">Am Oved Publishing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Theodore Herzl was the visionary who foresaw the State of Israel. No one disputes that. But the state also had a founding father, Chaim Weizmann, whose name has been forgotten, and whose crown was placed on the head of another: David Ben-Gurion. Had it not been for Chaim Weizmann, Herzl might have been remembered only as a journalist and playwright, and Ben-Gurion would never have become \u201cBen-Gurion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Weizmann, who turned the vision of the State of Israel into a reality, was a man of contradictions. He had mesmerizing charisma but low self-confidence. He was a wonderful conversationalist but a poor public speaker. He was alienated from Eastern European Jewry but willing to give his life for it. He was a people person and a ladies' man, but was always Vera\u2019s partner, for better or worse. He was a hypochondriac who also knew real sickness. He was British to the core and at the same time was an uncompromising Zionist. And, in particular, he was a man who struggled to live in the land in which the country of his dreams had been established.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Weizmann showed that the most effective action for the Zionist enterprise would best be carried out in London or New York, rather than in Jerusalem. After sacrificing his scientific career, his family, and his health for the most important matter in his life, Weizmann came to the State of Israel in body, but perhaps not in soul. The Israeli collective memory never forgave him and remembers him as the first, but powerless, president. This book by&nbsp;Professor Motti Golani, faculty member of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, and&nbsp;Professor Jehuda Reinharz, President of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation, reveals Weizmann in all his human complexity.<\/p>\n<p>\n   <a href=\"https:\/\/www.e-vrit.co.il\/Product\/18805\/\u05d4\u05d0\u05d1_\u05d4\u05de\u05d9\u05d9\u05e1\u05d3\" title=\"Read the foreword on the e-vrit website (Hebrew) >>\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read the foreword on the e-vrit website (Hebrew) &gt;&gt;<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div>\n   <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9EGWjiIC2g4&amp;ab_channel=%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9F%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%A9%D7%9D%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D%D7%95%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%9E%D7%9F\" title=\"Watch the Chaim Weizmann Institute's book launch (Hebrew) >>\" target=\"_blank\">Watch the Chaim Weizmann Institute's book launch (Hebrew) &gt;&gt;<\/a><\/strong><br><\/div>\n<div> \n   <br> \n<\/div>\n<div><div style=\"height:2px;border-bottom:1px solid #a8cfe7;\"><\/div><div> \n      <br> \n   <\/div><div> \n      <strong>\n         <em>The content of the books above represents the view of the authors and does not necessarily reflect the view of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel.<\/em><\/strong><br><\/div>\n   <br> \n<\/div>\n","images":{"newsletter-books-n.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Newsletter-books-n.jpg","caption":""},"hirschfeld-book.png":{"src":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Hirschfeld-book.png","caption":""},"yuval-evri-book.png":{"src":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Yuval-Evri-book.png","caption":""},"ayman-play.png":{"src":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Ayman-play.png","caption":""},"volansky-book.png":{"src":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Volansky-Book.png","caption":""},"golani-reinharz-book.png":{"src":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Golani-Reinharz-book.png","caption":""}},"attachments":[],"outer_links":[{"title":"Read the Table of Contents and Introduction (Hebrew) >>","url":"https:\/\/kotar.cet.ac.il\/KotarApp\/Viewer.aspx?nBookID=106256140#10.4905.6.default"},{"title":"Read the table of contents and introduction (Hebrew) >>","url":"https:\/\/www.magnespress.co.il\/api\/magnes\/book\/6054\/preview"},{"title":"Watch Yuval Evri talking about the book in an Oxford University podcast (English) >>","url":"https:\/\/podcasts.ox.ac.uk\/reconsidering-early-jewish-nationalist-ideologies-seminar-yuval-evri-kcl-return-al-andalus"},{"title":"Read the play in Hebrew and Arabic >>","url":"https:\/\/maktoobooks.com\/\u05d9\u05de\u05d9-\u05d4\u05ea\u05e0\u05d6\u05d9\u05dd-\u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645-\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0646\u0638\u064a\u0645"},{"title":"Watch the Tel Aviv University conference that marked the book\u2019s publication (Hebrew) >>","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t1yUZKtECJA&t=5s&ab_channel=TAUVOD"},{"title":"Read the foreword on the e-vrit website (Hebrew) >>","url":"https:\/\/www.e-vrit.co.il\/Product\/18805\/\u05d4\u05d0\u05d1_\u05d4\u05de\u05d9\u05d9\u05e1\u05d3"},{"title":"Watch the Chaim Weizmann Institute's book launch (Hebrew) >>","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9EGWjiIC2g4&ab_channel=%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9F%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%A9%D7%9D%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D%D7%95%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%9E%D7%9F"}]},"supporting-lone-soldiers-during-the-pandemic":{"title":"Supporting Lone Soldiers during the Pandemic","date":"2021-04-06","image":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Beit-Benji-ns.jpg","excerpt":"Mandel Foundation grants enabled Habayit Shel Benji to provide necessary support to lone soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces during the lockdowns\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Supporting-Lone-Soldiers-during-the-Pandemic.aspx","is_inner":"yes","slug":"supporting-lone-soldiers-during-the-pandemic","text":"\nSome 1,250 lone combat soldiers serve in the IDF.

Built in memory of Benji Hillman, a British-born company commander who was killed in the Second Lebanon War, Habayit Shel Benji continues Hillman's legacy of caring for lone soldiers. Located in Ra'anana, it provides lone combat soldiers with support for challenges they encounter and needs that arise during and after their service in the IDF.\n\nCurrently, Habayit Shel Benji houses 87 lone soldiers, providing them with three meals a day, clean laundry, space for themselves, expert guidance, and the 24\/7 support of a \u201cfamily.\u201d This is accomplished through the efforts of the home's devoted staff and a network of volunteers from the community. The home also provides guidance to lone soldiers in transitioning into civilian life after their military service. To date, it has helped over 2,000 lone soldiers find employment, apartments, furnishings, and scholarships following their service.\nCOVID-19 changed everything for Habayit Shel Benji. Suddenly, the home found itself dealing with issues it had never confronted before. The soldiers who live there were more vulnerable both physically and emotionally, and the organization\u2019s financial support system started to show cracks. The repeated lockdowns had an impact on the goods that were donated to the home and shut out the volunteers who contribute their time to the home.\nAs part of the Mandel Foundation's response to the coronavirus crisis in Israel, Habayit Shel Benji received two grants that enabled it to continue supporting its lone soldiers throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. When the large monthly food donations that help feed the soldiers stopped arriving during the lockdown, the Mandel Foundation's financial support enabled the home to purchase food for soldiers who were able to return to their apartments and to make care packages for soldiers who were stuck on base for months on end.\nFunding from the Mandel Foundation also helped Habayit Shel Benji compensate for the fact that most of its volunteers were not able to come during the lockdown, which affected the home's ongoing staffing. The funds allowed the home to employ an extra staff member to cover night shifts, which included managing the front desk, supervising the kitchen, and remaining on-call throughout the night in case a soldier needed urgent help. The grants also enabled the home to purchase medical supplies, including masks, disinfectants, and thermometers, and to run mini-events on weekends, when soldiers came home from the army but had nothing to do because entertainment venues were all closed.\nThe Mandel Foundation grants thus played a vital role in helping Habayit Shel Benji, which is currently building a second home for lone soldiers adjacent to the first, to withstand the unique challenges of the COVID-19 crisis. Saul Rurka, CEO and Founder of the home, expressed his gratitude for the Foundation's support in 2020 and 2021, saying: \"Lone combat soldiers have given their lives to help the country; the least we can do is offer them a proper home and a loving family. We are grateful to the Mandel Foundation for helping us to be there for our soldiers at a time when they needed us most.\"\n\n\n","html_content":"<p>\u200b<img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Beit-Benji-n.jpg\" alt=\"Soldiers from Habayit Shel Benji\" class=\"img-responsive\"><span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Photo: Courtesy of Habayit Shel Benji<\/span><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Some 1,250 lone combat soldiers serve in the IDF.

The grants also enabled the home to purchase medical supplies, including masks, disinfectants, and thermometers, and to run mini-events on weekends, when soldiers came home from the army but had nothing to do because entertainment venues were all closed.<\/p>\n<p>The Mandel Foundation grants thus played a vital role in helping Habayit Shel Benji, which is currently building a second home for lone soldiers adjacent to the first, to withstand the unique challenges of the COVID-19 crisis. Saul Rurka, CEO and Founder of the home, expressed his gratitude for the Foundation's support in 2020 and 2021, saying: \"Lone combat soldiers have given their lives to help the country; the least we can do is offer them a proper home and a loving family. We are grateful to the Mandel Foundation for helping us to be there for our soldiers at a time when they needed us most.\"<br><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\"> \n   <iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/VmwPAg8s0lw?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n   <br> <\/div>\n","images":{"beit-benji-n.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Beit-Benji-n.jpg","caption":"Photo: Courtesy of Habayit Shel Benji"},"beit-benji-2.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Beit-Benji-2.jpg","caption":"Photo: Courtesy of Habayit Shel Benji"},"beit-benji-1.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Beit-Benji-1.jpg","caption":"Lone soldiers at Habayit Shel Benji (Courtesy of Habayit Shel Benji)"}},"attachments":[],"outer_links":[]},"mandel-fellows-day-2020\u20132021":{"title":"Mandel Fellows\u2019 Day 2020\u20132021","date":"2021-03-18","image":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/fellows-day-2021s.jpg","excerpt":"This event introduced current fellows to all the programs of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel in a customized virtual space that enabled encounters between fellows of different programs\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Mandel-Fellows-Day-2020\u20132021.aspx","is_inner":"yes","slug":"mandel-fellows-day-2020\u20132021","text":"\u201cThe goal of this event is to introduce you to the Foundation and its many activities, to help you realize that you are part of something much bigger that is making an impact in the State of Israel, improving things for Israeli society and all of Israel\u2019s citizens,\u201d said the director-general of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel, Moshe Vigdor, in his opening remarks.\nParticipants in the first ever Fellows' Day of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel, which was held on March 18, 2021, included the fellows, faculty, and staff of all Mandel programs, as well as the Foundation's administrative staff.

Meet the new directors of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North, the Mandel Graduate Community, the Mandel Program for Academic Leadership, and\u00a0the Mandel Youth Leadership\u00a0Program, who share their visions for their work in their new positions.\n\n\nMiki Nevo Director, Mandel Center for Leadership in the North\nMiki Nevo, a social entrepreneur, is the director of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North. Prior to his current position, he was the director of the Mandel Youth Leadership\u00a0Program\u00a0of the Mandel Leadership Institute for five years. Miki has some twenty-five years' experience in founding and managing social and educational organizations. He was principal of the Misgav secondary school, and founded and directed the Israel Venture Network\u2019s educational activities in Israel\u2019s northern social periphery. He founded and directed the Ma\u2019ase Center, which promotes socioeconomic mobility by providing volunteering frameworks for young adults from Israel\u2019s social periphery, served as senior assistant director of research and development of the Rashi Foundation, and founded and directed Living Together \u2013 The Center for a New Social Partnership in Israel. In recognition of his work with Ma\u2019ase, Miki was awarded the Sderot Conference for Society\u2019s Prize for Excellence in Social Affairs, the Speaker of the Knesset\u2019s Quality of Life Prize, and an honorary doctorate from Tel Aviv University. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and a master\u2019s degree in neurobiology, both from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Miki is a graduate of Cohort 4 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership.\nThe Mandel Center for Leadership in the North strives to realize the mission of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel through a deep understanding of the unique fabric of the North, which is made up of vastly different communities \u2013 national religious, ultra-Orthodox, traditional, and secular Jews, Muslim and Christian Arabs, Bedouin, Druze, and Circassians \u2013 who live together in the shared space of Israel's northern periphery. We will identify and recruit outstanding fellows who share the desire to achieve a society that is fair and just, and provide them with leadership programs. Over time these programs will achieve optimal coverage of the whole region, in order to have a maximal impact on the North. Our programs, which will address the most significant topics in Israeli life, will be based on a curriculum that emphasizes the humanities.\nOur programs will also emphasize leadership in a digital world as well as management skills that will help our graduates to impact the field. Taking a multi-disciplinary approach that includes a variety of perspectives, the programs will also explore the meaning of \u201ccommunity\u201d in our times and the challenges of community building. We will facilitate connections between local populations, the local authorities, and the government, and will strengthen local leadership in both government systems and civil society.\n\n\nMaya Bozo-Schwartz Director, Mandel Graduate Community\nMaya Bozo-Schwartz is the director of the Mandel Graduate Community and has extensive experience in leading pedagogical change processes in schools and in systemic change processes in education. Before being appointed to her current position, she was the director of the Mandel Leadership Institute's Mandel Program for Academic Leadership. Prior to that, Maya was a member of the management team and head of research and development at Avney Rosha \u2013 the Israel Institute for School Leadership. She also worked at the Branco Weiss Institute, where she founded and co-directed its research and development unit. Maya holds a bachelor\u2019s degree from the department of education and from the multidisciplinary program at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and has a master\u2019s degree in philosophy of education from the same institution. She is currently working on her doctoral dissertation in the department of education at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, where her research explores verbal feedback in the school classroom. Maya is a graduate of Cohort 13 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership.\nFor many years, I have worked closely with hundreds of teachers and principals to develop their leadership and professional skills. I have seen how educational leaders create bold and meaningful change. But alongside my appreciation for their outstanding achievements, I have come to understand that working with a given principal or school individually, as important as it may be, is not sufficient for achieving real change. The challenges facing the Israeli education system are so daunting, and the difficulties involved in leading change are so complex, that no single leader can do it alone, however talented they may be. In addition to the outstanding principals I have met, there have always been staff members, colleagues, and devoted parents who partnered in the work. In other words, these leaders are surrounded by a community\u00a0 \u2013 diverse, strong, and full of partners who speak a similar language and work together to create a new reality.\nI view my new position as director of the Mandel Graduate Community\u00a0 as an opportunity to create such an educational-social community \u2013 a community whose purpose is to lead change for the better in the Israeli education system and Israeli society, across its different and diverse groups. The Mandel Graduate Community numbers over 1,500 such leaders, who share a common language and way of thinking, as they have grown and developed in Mandel programs and have experienced the unique Mandel learning processes. My task in the coming year is to establish a unit that will be a professional, proactive, attentive, relevant, and high-quality home for the Foundation\u2019s graduates. Its role will be to strengthen the work and impact of our graduates and to provide them with opportunities for cutting-edge learning, professional support, implementation, and networking. I am confident that in this home, we will create a long-term professional partnership that will support each of our graduates throughout their careers, and will help the Mandel Foundation realize its vision.\n\n\nIdo Barkan Director, Mandel Program for Academic Leadership\nIdo Barkan is the director of the Mandel Program for Academic Leadership. Before joining the Mandel Leadership Institute, he was the head of the school superintendent division and a member of the management of Avney Rosha\u2013The Israel Institute for School Leadership, where he led training and professional development for superintendents working for the Ministry of Education.. In recent years, Ido has served as a senior mentor in the Global Business Studies Program at the faculty of management of Tel Aviv University, an MBA program for outstanding international students. He is also one of the founders of the New School of Holon, a unique public school patterned after High Tech High in San Diego, which focuses on project-based learning. Ido began his career as a strategy consultant at TASC consulting firm. He holds a master's degree in education policy (magna cum laude) from Tel Aviv University and a bachelor's degree from the Amirim program for outstanding students and the cognitive science department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is a graduate of Advot, a joint venture between the Ministry of Education and MAOZ that aims to create a senior management pipeline for Israel's education system.\nFor me, leadership is a combination of clear values, high standards of professionalism, and motivation to act. When it comes to education, leadership is an inherent part of the educational act.

I have seen how educational leaders create bold and meaningful change. But alongside my appreciation for their outstanding achievements, I have come to understand that working with a given principal or school individually, as important as it may be, is not sufficient for achieving real change. The challenges facing the Israeli education system are so daunting, and the difficulties involved in leading change are so complex, that no single leader can do it alone, however talented they may be. In addition to the outstanding principals I have met, there have always been staff members, colleagues, and devoted parents who partnered in the work.

The Mandel Graduate Community numbers over 1,500 such leaders, who share a common language and way of thinking, as they have grown and developed in Mandel programs and have experienced the unique Mandel learning processes. My task in the coming year is to establish a unit that will be a professional, proactive, attentive, relevant, and high-quality home for the Foundation\u2019s graduates. Its role will be to strengthen the work and impact of our graduates and to provide them with opportunities for cutting-edge learning, professional support, implementation, and networking.

This unprecedented situation presented Haredi society with some highly unique challenges.\nIn normal times, the Haredi education system has long school days and short vacations. During vacations, the school system provides entertainment and leisure activities that are tailored to the needs and character of the Haredi community. In addition, community life provides young people in the Haredi community with a holistic social experience that includes daily synagogue prayers, study groups, weddings, and other celebrations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which shut down all these institutions and activities, created difficulties for all socioeconomic strata in Haredi society. Even \u201cnormative\u201d families found themselves facing, for the first time, emotional and behavioral difficulties in their children, due to severe boredom and isolation. As a result, youth who would not usually be considered \u201cat-risk\u201d could now\u00a0be seen as members of an at-risk group.\nDuring this period, at-risk families who had already experienced major challenges and difficulties before the pandemic found themselves exposed to very strong risk factors, and experienced a great sense of helplessness. Students who struggled with academic content became effectively incapacitated in the absence of any stable study framework, and young people who struggled to maintain a daily routine lost their bearings completely due to their lack of structure. These phenomena were exacerbated during the lockdown by the inability to maintain contact with friends, schools, and other community institutions via technological means that are available in other communities, as computers, smartphones, and internet access are not generally available to Haredi\u00a0youth.\nIn order to be able to maintain contact with their students during the lockdown, schools in the Haredi sector needed to find alternative methods. They set up phone lines that made it possible for students to listen to lessons in real time or to listen to pre-recorded lessons. But the fact that Haredi families are much larger than the average family in Israel made this challenging. Each family usually has just one landline, not every child has a mobile phone, and families often live in small, cramped apartments in which it is difficult for children to find a suitable place for listening to lessons.\nBeitar Illit, one of the largest Haredi cities in Israel and the city with the largest proportion of young people, identified the suffering and the huge risk presented by this situation, and sought solutions. The municipality contacted the Netzach school network, a Haredi\u00a0school network that provides a traditional religious education alongside a \u201ccore curriculum\u201d of secular subjects. The network provides both elementary and secondary education, and operates one school in Beitar Illit. With the help of the Mandel Foundation, the Netzach network was able to create special responses to the needs of\u00a0both normative and at-risk youth in the city.\nFor normative youth \u2013 students aged 14\u201317 who attended regular yeshiva and seminary settings \u2013\u00a0a special system was created to provide content-based activities. Three dedicated phone lines for multiple users, each marketed with its own name, were set up in order to serve young people from the three sectors of\u00a0Haredi\u00a0Jews in the city: Sephardic, Hasidic, and those\u00a0associated with the Lithuanian stream. The project engaged thousands of young people in specially adapted activities and studies during a period when no other educational or social options were available to them. A total of 56,400 calls took place as part of the project, each providing content and activities to the youth. In addition, tens of raffles of small prizes were conducted as part of the project, which increased the engagement of the young people of the community.\nFor at-risk youth, a major project was set up to provide academic and emotional support to children and youth who are followed by truant officers in the Beitar Illit municipality. These children are academically behind and are at high risk for dropping out of school. In many cases, they come from troubled homes or their parents have divorced or died. The project was hugely successful in keeping these young people from slipping into delinquency and living on the streets.\nThe project provided technological, organizational, and pedagogical tools for maintaining academic and educational relationships between young people and their mentors. It helped the youth continue to develop during the challenging period, while keeping them within the framework of the community and encouraging them to remain in school.\nAs part of this project, special educational content was created to meet the demands of this highly difficult period. The Netzach network provided training and guidance for the mentors in the project, as well as pedagogical and technological supervision. Approximately 60 mentors participated in the project, serving 280 students from the different population groups in the city. The project\u2019s activities were monitored in coordination with the schools, the truant officers, the mentors, and the students\u2019 families. All support activities were carried out using laptops that were provided to the mentors and students, ensuring continued activity and contact during lockdowns.\nIn the best of times, it is difficult to set up emergency teams and start projects from scratch in such a short period; all the more so during a major national and in fact worldwide crisis such as the coronavirus pandemic. With support and guidance from Netzach, the municipality\u2019s teams worked hard to provide the necessary responses and to implement the project successfully and professionally.\nThe fruits of this project are evident on the ground. The organizers have heard moving stories about students who were able to succeed on exams and maintain some kind of routine, thanks to the tools that were made available by the project. Tens of young people, both boys and girls, received a lifeline that enabled them to survive the stormy waters of their lives, which during the pandemic became a tempest.

According to some researchers, tens of talented young Inca men and women were sent to this site each year for training in a range of subjects and skills that would prepare them to serve as leaders of the empire. In other words, more than six centuries ago, people clearly understood the importance of leadership training.\nThe imperial Inca training school, however, has little in common with the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation and its approach to leadership training, which is the subject of Katzman\u2019s book. The former was authoritarian and reserved for the ruling classes only, while the latter is the \u201cproduct of a Jewish culture that demands interaction and disagreement\u201d (p. 2).\nThe journey of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation began with a charged meeting between Professor Seymour Fox and Morton L. Mandel. At the time, Fox, a former yeshiva student with a doctorate in education from the University of Chicago, was the acting director of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York and was devoting his life to Jewish education.\u00a0Mandel, the son of a family of Jewish immigrants from Poland who settled in Cleveland, was a gifted businessman, public activist, and generous philanthropist \u2013 a man \u201cwith a warm embrace, a welcoming countenance, a supportive and encouraging demeanor\u2026 and a remarkable memory, who remained focused and alert into his tenth decade\u2026. He also knew how to express a very effective tone of displeasure. He was a serious man with many soft spots, and endless generosity\u201d (p. 24).\nFox and Mandel agreed that Jewish education, in a constant state of crisis, must undergo professionalization, which requires great commitment and investment. The two of them sought \u201cto train the senior educators and educational researchers in the Jewish world, develop public leadership, and establish a program that would connect Jewish communities with schools, universities, and the full range of informal educational activities, including youth movements, community centers, Israel trips, and summer camps\u201d (p. 356). They were joined by Annette Hochstein, who served as consultant, planner, and manager, and who is the focus of the book\u2019s first chapter.\nThe guiding principle behind all Mandel institutions and activities has been the encounter between the world of theory \u2013 great ideas, great people, and great books \u2013 on the one hand, and \u201cthe complex and flawed reality found in practice,\" on the other (p. 14). \"The decisive embodiment of the encounter between these two sides is the living, human encounter \u2013 with eyes and ears, mouth and nose, with figures and maps and examples and pages, whether viewed in print or on screen \u2013 on the one hand, and with the field itself \u2013 with its sweat and dust, obstacles and constraints, noise and stench \u2013 on the other hand\u201d (p. 15). This approach was combined with the principle of selecting outstanding people and placing them in key positions \u2013 in Morton Mandel\u2019s words, \u201cit\u2019s all about who.\u201d This was how an auto parts business that the Mandel brothers bought for $900 in 1940 grew, within five decades, into a huge, billion-dollar corporation, whose profits enabled the brothers to establish one of the largest Jewish education philanthropic foundations in the world.\nKatzman, a faculty member at the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel, culture critic, journalist, and editor, has taught at institutes of higher education throughout Israel and edited numerous works of non-fiction, including the \u201cMar\u2019ei Makom\u201d series on education and Israeli and Jewish identity, a joint venture of the Mandel Foundation and Keter Books. His new book, published by the Mandel Foundation and Magnes Press, examines the impact of the Foundation via the personal stories of a number of key figures and Mandel graduates.\nKatzman conducted 19 interviews with some of the most notable people involved in the Foundation's establishment and with graduates of its two main full-time programs over the years: the Jerusalem Fellows program and the Mandel School for Educational Leadership. Designed for educators and community leaders from all Jewish denominations, the Jerusalem Fellows program was launched in 1982, was taken under the umbrella of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel (which was founded in 1990), and ended its operations in 2011. Launched in the early 1990s, the Mandel School for Educational Leadership aims to develop the future leaders of the field of education in Israel and is now training its 29th cohort. Both programs recruited fellows who had proven professional and managerial experience, aiming to improve the capabilities of the fellows and help them become more effective leaders.\nThe book is divided into chapters detailing the individual stories of Mandel figures who are dedicating their lives to the complicated field of education in general and Jewish education in particular, and who are leading change. Each story presents the biography and personal journey of an outstanding leader, uncovering their charismatic personality and offering a deeper understanding of the tremendous impact they have had on pedagogical thinking and intellectual discourse in Israel and the Jewish world. As Katzman explains, \u201cMort Mandel and his desire to create change in the world are the driving engine behind all the stories\u201d in the book, which provides insights into how Mandelian precepts and the principles of Jewish education are translated by the Mandel Foundation into ripples of change.\nOne of the chapters tells the story of Gila Ben-Har, a graduate of Cohort 1 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership who subsequently became the head of the Tel Aviv municipal education administration and the CEO of the Center for Educational Technology (CET), and now heads innovation, pedagogy, and digital learning at the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel. In Katzman\u2019s words, \u201cthe main key for discovering new worlds, and unfamiliar directions and paths, is human relations. This is the secret of her excellence as a manager\u201d (p. 158). Ben-Har is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor from Poland, a sister of a fallen IDF soldier, and one of the most influential women in Israel. Under her leadership, CET attained remarkable achievements. As Katzman tells it, she \u201cguides a treasure ship (disguised as a wonderfully designed office building) of cutting-edge knowledge, innovation, and futurism. She is engaged in creativity, in forecasting and developing trends, and ultimately, in shaping the face of Israeli society via the immense influence that the Center for Educational Technology has on the tools and content used by the Israeli education system\u201d (p. 158).\nAnother chapter tells the story of Ruben Sternschein, a graduate of Cohort 22 of the Jerusalem Fellows program and rabbi of the Jewish community in Sao Paulo, Brazil \u2013 the largest Jewish community in Latin America, and one of the largest in the world. Sternschein focuses on the fundamental question facing the Jewish world in our times, and perhaps in all ages (p. 55): \u201cHow can Judaism\u00a0be transformed from fading, decorative nostalgia into a practical philosophy that guides our daily lives? How can Jewish sources be translated into simple yet inspirational language, to make Judaism accessible to all Jews?\u201d\nSternschein explains: \u201cBringing together these worlds\u2026 involves an intensive, complex, and successful combination of philosophy and psychology, education and business, which is also the source of Mandelian language. This dialogue between disciplines opens you up. Each person brings something from their own little bubble, and makes your bubble look different\u201d (p. 59).\nThe interviews are artfully interwoven with each other throughout the book, all in Katzman\u2019s unique language \u2013 analytical, ironic, and occasionally poetic.\nKatzman concludes: \u201cEverything is education. This was the message of the prophets of Israel, the Greek philosophers, and their great descendants, each in their own words and images. In the end, education drives change. The desire for change is the beating heart of the Mandel Leadership Institute, the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, and the Mandel Centers for Leadership in the North and in the Negev. And yes, change can sometimes take the form of a light touch that has tremendous impact\u201d (p. 361).\n_____\nJoining the Great Conversation:\u00a0The Mandel Foundation and the Ripples of Change by Avi Katzman, published by the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation and Magnes Press (390 pages).\n\n","html_content":"<p>\u200b<img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Katzman-book-ENG.jpg\" alt=\"Joining the Great Conversation: The Mandel Foundation and the Ripples of Chang\" class=\"img-responsive\"><br><\/p>\n<p>In the introduction to \n   <em>Joining the Great Conversation: The Mandel Foundation and the Ripples of Change<\/em>, \n   <strong>Avi Katzman<\/strong> describes what he calls the \u201cInca Kingdom School of Leadership\u201d\u2014the Machu Picchu archeological site in Peru, one of the most visited sites in South America and one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

He described the Foundation\u2019s achievements during the past year, taking particular pride in the Foundation\u2019s contributions during the COVID\u00a0pandemic to disadvantaged populations and initiatives in Israel and the United States in need of support. \u201cWe think about you all the time,\u201d he said to Mr. Mandel. \u201cWe cite your words of wisdom and we tell your stories ... and most of all, we miss you very much.\u201d\nFoundation chairman Steve Hoffman recalled that \"at the beginning of the year, we lost Mort and then Barbara.

I think Mort would have been pleased with the way his plans for the future began to be implemented, with a fully engaged board of trustees, and an excellent staff leadership team.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn a video clip produced for the ceremony, Mandel graduates spoke of the impact that Mort Mandel had on their lives, the way their studies at Mandel contributed to their professional development, and the importance of the Mandel Foundation in education and society in Israel. \u201cHow did Mandel impact me?\u201d summed up Tzipora Gutman, graduate of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership and founder of the Kfar Shira residential school for ultra-Orthodox young women, \u201cwith infinite goodness. Truly infinite.\u201d\nMusical works by Salamone Rossi and George Frideric Handel, which were performed by the Jerusalem Baroque Orchestra, enhanced the ceremony. The event concluded with a fascinating lecture on examples of leadership in Hebrew poetry by Mandel faculty member Professor Ariel Hirschfeld, a professor of Hebrew literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\u00a0\nScores of Mandel graduates, fellows, and employees viewed the moving ceremony, as it was broadcast from Jerusalem.

He described the Foundation\u2019s achievements during the past year, taking particular pride in the Foundation\u2019s contributions during the COVID&nbsp;pandemic to disadvantaged populations and initiatives in Israel and the United States in need of support. \u201cWe think about you all the time,\u201d he said to Mr. Mandel. \u201cWe cite your words of wisdom and we tell your stories ... and most of all, we miss you very much.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Foundation chairman \n   <strong>Steve Hoffman<\/strong> recalled that \"at the beginning of the year, we lost Mort and then Barbara. We faced the new year without our founders, but committed to carrying on their legacy through our work. I think Mort would have been pleased with the way his plans for the future began to be implemented, with a fully engaged board of trustees, and an excellent staff leadership team.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>In a video clip produced for the ceremony, Mandel graduates spoke of the impact that Mort Mandel had on their lives, the way their studies at Mandel contributed to their professional development, and the importance of the Mandel Foundation in education and society in Israel. \u201cHow did Mandel impact me?\u201d summed up \n   <strong>Tzipora Gutman<\/strong>, graduate of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership and founder of the Kfar Shira residential school for ultra-Orthodox young women, \u201cwith infinite goodness. Truly infinite.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Musical works by Salamone Rossi and George Frideric Handel, which were performed by the Jerusalem Baroque Orchestra, enhanced the ceremony. The event concluded with a fascinating lecture on examples of leadership in Hebrew poetry by Mandel faculty member Professor \n   <strong>Ariel Hirschfeld<\/strong>, a professor of Hebrew literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Scores of Mandel graduates, fellows, and employees viewed the moving ceremony, as it was broadcast from Jerusalem. The new fellows may not have had the privilege of meeting Mr. Mandel \u2013 an esteemed leader, generous philanthropist, lover of Israel, and source of inspiration \u2013 but his wisdom and values are being passed on to them, and they will continue his legacy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/MLM-memorial-en-2020.jpg\" alt=\"Remembering Morton L.

This new reality is dictating substantial changes in our educational activities, including our teaching methods and styles of learning.\nAround the world, some 1.3 billion students of all ages have suddenly shifted to home learning, without the structured timetables and organized spaces that have characterized formal education over the last century.

What are the theoretical and practical aspects of teaching and learning processes as they relate to this new situation? How can we lead change and create innovative new processes?\nThrough shared learning opportunities, the \"Teaching in a Hybrid Environment\" series, led by Gila Ben-Har, manager of innovation, pedagogy\u00a0and\u00a0digital learning\u00a0at the\u00a0Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel,\u00a0sought to create discourse and debate that would give participants an understanding of the tremendous opportunities being created in pedagogic contexts, and to enable them to experience these opportunities firsthand. The sessions offered Mandel faculty members a window onto learning in hybrid environments. This article reviews the first three events of the series, which introduced participants to internet culture, to the innovation it has fostered, and to the new forms of pedagogy stemming from these.\nOnline Culture Meets Learning\nThe first online session, titled \"Online Culture Meets Learning,\" examined internet culture and the opportunities it offers for learning. We met with Professor Sheizaf Rafaeli, president of Shenkar College of Engineering, Design and Art, who previously founded and directed the Center for Information Society Research and headed the Center for Internet Research and the Internet Lab at the University of Haifa.\nProfessor Rafaeli examined the internet as a network of interpersonal connections. He discussed the transition from the analog age of the printed word to the digital age.\u00a0 Is it possible to teach, learn, and educate via computers and networks, or do these actually represent a threat to the education system?\u00a0 In his view, we are advancing toward a better world, but should not ignore the criticism.\nProfessor Rafaeli described internet culture as having eight characteristics that share the common motif of death: the death of the book in its original form; the death of distance, time, and center, which disappear on the internet; the death of privacy; the death of discourse, which has become harsh and inciting; the death of memory, as technology remembers for us; the death of truth, as algorithms become more important than facts; the death of the classroom as we know it, and the death of the promise.\n\n\nThe World of Learning Reinvents Itself\nThe second lecture in the series, \u201cWhen the Whale Turns Over: The World of Learning Reinvents Itself,\u201d was led by Avi Warshavsky, founder and CEO of the MindCET EdTech innovation center\u00a0and and one of the leading figures in EdTech both in Israel and in the international community. He presented a conceptual approach to mechanisms of disruption and how they are expressed in the current digital revolution, and outlined a possible strategy for action in these areas.\nWarshavsky discussed the concept of disruption and of Clayton Christensen\u2019s theory of \u201cdisruptive innovation,\u201d and examined the implications of this theory for education and learning during the coronavirus pandemic. He provided contemporary examples of disruption, such as Netflix's disruption of cinema, Uber's disruption of the taxi industry, Airbnb's disruption of the hotel world, and Wikipedia's disruption of the world of encyclopedias. In the world of education and learning, the disruption may be less obvious, but the trends are similar. The large increase in the number of students being homeschooled, the learning that is made possible by online courses, and the learning that is springing up around YouTubers, all are examples of disruptive processes that are becoming more developed in the world of education.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the process of disruption, to the point at which 80% of students in the world are currently not attending school. Distance learning has been accelerated, educational institutions have been weakened, the role of parents in education has changed, and end-user devices such as smartphones have become essential. According to Warshavsky, this is a process we cannot ignore; we must reimagine the world of learning.\n\nA New Pedagogy: On the Nature of Learning in Hybrid Environments\nThe third session of the series featured Dr. Cecilia Waismann, VP of research and development at MindCET, who is at the forefront of educational research in Israel. Her lecture, \u201cA New Pedagogy: On the Nature of Learning in Hybrid Environments,\u201d focused on the impact of today's realities on pedagogy, and explored the implications of the revolution we are currently experiencing for concepts such as literacy, education, and learning.\nDr. Waisman examined the new pedagogy of the digital age from an optimistic perspective by exploring five main challenges that she sees as offering great opportunity. She stressed that while areas of our lives such as healthcare are already hurtling toward change, education is still frozen, and must climb aboard. Additional challenges include the challenge of uncertainty, which is both a weakness and an opportunity; the challenge of accessibility and connectivity, where opportunity lies in machine learning and artificial intelligence; the challenge of leading change via students and by using new forms of thinking, such as harnessing YouTubers as leaders of learning; and the encounter between people and machines, in which augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence offer new opportunities for the world of learning.\nDr. Waismann wondered who will change the rules of the game in education and to what extent the structure of the education system determines pedagogy, and perhaps prevents change. She discussed the issue of attention economy, which is driving a new pedagogic approach, as well as a number of other trends, including entrepreneurship and innovation, self-regulated learning and personalized learning, and the emergence of hybrid learning. She concluded her session by stating: \u201cIn order to ensure that the world of education remains relevant to students, we must understand the new learning environments and develop pedagogic strategies that support students\u2019 development as citizens of the world.\u201d\n\n","html_content":"<p>\u200b<img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/hybrid-teaching-01-ENG.jpg\" alt=\"Teaching in a Hybrid Environment\" class=\"img-responsive\"><br><\/p>\n<p>Years from now, when&nbsp;many of us&nbsp;recall seeing Zoom for the first time in 2020, we will also remember a little virus that changed the course of human history, altering the way we live, work, and study.<\/p>\n<p>The COVID pandemic presented us with a new reality in all areas of life, both social and professional.

As the numbers of cases rose, and Israelis were ordered to stay at home, challenges escalated rapidly. Unemployment rose to unprecedented rates, parents were forced to supervise online education, and underprivileged populations found themselves in increasingly untenable circumstances.\nUnderstanding the urgency of the situation, the Mandel Foundation responded by donating $4.8M to help Israeli society face challenges brought on by the crisis. Some $3.6M of these funds were given to a wide range of nonprofit organizations and causes in Israel, including $500K to the city of Jerusalem,\u00a0while the remaining $1M was allocated to 94 vital initiatives proposed by Mandel graduates to address the crisis in diverse sectors of society. Of the 94 grantees, 8 were awarded NIS 75,000; 30 were awarded NIS 50,000; and 56 were awarded NIS 25,000.\nThese unique initiatives, which focused on\u00a0some of society\u2019s most pressing issues, were created to help a wide range of communities, including Jews, Arabs, Bedouin, Druze, residents of East Jerusalem, ultra-Orthodox Jews, asylum-seekers, and women without citizenship. The projects were designed to serve populations including at risk youth, children with special needs, single mothers, victims of domestic violence, needy families, the elderly, people with disabilities, and medical personnel. The initiatives focused on areas such as employment training, online learning, community resilience, and distribution of food, medication, and protective equipment. Many of the projects were developed for implementation in Israel\u2019s periphery.\nIn-depth descriptions of six of these inspiring and impactful graduate initiatives can be found here:\nEthiopian Youth: An \u201cEmergency Force\u201d in the Community \u2013 An initiative by Dr. Nigist Mengesha, graduate of Cohort 3 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership and director of the FIDEL Association, which she founded to advance the full integration of the Ethiopian-Israeli community into Israeli society Protecting Arab Women from Abuse and Murder \u2013 A project initiated by Samah Salaime, graduate of Cohort 21 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership and director of Na'am\u2013Arab Women in the Center (AWC) Maintaining Routine for Students in Special Education \u2013 An emergency program developed by Chinuch Ve\u2019Atid, a nonprofit founded by Elchanan Visenshteren, graduate of the Mandel Program for Leadership Development in the Haredi Community Supporting the Periphery during the Crisis\u00a0\u2013 A program launched by Nisim Elmakayes, graduate of the Mandel Program for Local Leadership in Yeruham and Ramat Hanegev and founder of the Meir Panim branch in Dimona-Yeruham Preventing Domestic Violence through Occupational Rehabilitation \u2013 An initiative by Doris Mor, graduate of Cohort 12 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership and founder of the Oganim Institute and the \u201cDo Not Walk Alone\u201d program Increasing Community Resilience for an Ongoing Emergency \u2013 A multi-organizational national collaboration headed by two graduates of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership: Guy Tsfoni and Dr. Sara Shadmi-Wortman, both leading experts in community building\nAn additional project that received support was carried out by Dr. Michal Hemmo-Lotem, a graduate of Cohort 2 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership and founder and CEO of Osheya. Michal\u2019s initiative supported women healthcare workers, who were impacted by the crisis in every aspect of their lives. These women on the frontline were given assistance through support groups, emergency mentoring, and building a community. Yoav Braver, a graduate Cohort 4 of the Mandel Youth Leadership Program and founder of the Cyber Education Center, initiated a project that was particularly relevant at a time when schools were closed. He developed online courses and a structured, guided group process to enable teens from the periphery to acquire computer skills, including programming, and to improve their problem-solving skills in a supportive environment.Another initiative was led by Yael Boneh Levy, a graduate of Cohort 3 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership and founder of the Lasova Association. During the crisis, Lasova purchased food baskets, diapers, and milk substitutes for 216 families of asylum seekers and migrant workers, providing assistance until parents could once again earn a living.The dramatic rise in unemployment during the crisis led to an acute need to assist young Bedouin in finding suitable employment. Hend Abu Jaffer, a graduate of the Mandel Program for Local Leadership in Rahat, provided support for around 40 young Bedouin (aged 25-45) who were laid off, underemployed, or entering the job market to find appropriate jobs that would integrate them more successfully into the workforce. Ofir Libstein, a graduate of Cohort 2 of the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in Beer Sheva and\u00a0head of the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council,\u00a0developed an initiative to assist small and independent business owners by supporting the local business-community with peer learning, networking, local procurement, and sustainability.An initiative by Tyseer Atamnah, a graduate of the Mandel Program for Local Leadership in Baqa Al-Gharbiyye and founder of the Golden Age Center, created a remote system that would provide elderly people in Baqa Al-Gharbiyye with enrichment activities, relieve their loneliness, and facilitate their access to necessary services. Batia Berkowicz, a graduate of the pilot program for the women's track of the Mandel Program for Leadership Development in the Haredi Community, initiated a project to protect ultra-Orthodox children from sexual abuse during the crisis. The project created an online workshop to train teachers on how to make direct and indirect contact with children, to identify crisis situations, and to provide critical follow-up. As part of the initiative, an advertising campaign targeting the Haredi community included contact information for receiving support.To assist the Druze community, Lotfy Harb, a graduate of Cohort 9 of the Mandel IDF Educational Leadership Program and founder of the nonprofit Afikim L\u2019Atid, initiated a project called \u201cA Computer for Every Child.\u201d The shift from classroom learning to remote learning was particularly problematic for Druze children in poor villages, who often do not have computers at home. Lotfy\u2019s initiative purchased computers for those who lacked them, including old computers that were refurbished by a company that employs people with special needs. Ada Trossman, a graduate of Cohort 4 of the Mandel Senior Civil Service Program and founder of the nonprofit Isha L\u2019Isha\u00a0\u2013 Haifa Feminist Center, initiated a project to provide targeted, personalized, and immediate assistance to women at risk. Her Corona Women's Rescue Program provided assistance to women without citizen status, creating an emergency fund for food, rent, medical expenses, and children\u2019s needs. A hotline for inquiries and emergency calls extended its hours to 24\/7, call centers were set up, and information was disseminated in all the relevant languages.The Mandel Foundation is proud of the inspiring and worthy initiatives launched by our graduates during the crisis and of the creative leadership roles that our graduates assumed at this difficult time. Although only a few of the 94 initiatives that received support from the Foundation are mentioned in this article, we are deeply gratified to know that all of them contributed greatly to their communities and to Israel as a whole.Beyond the grants awarded to graduate initiatives, the Mandel Graduate Unit awarded a total of NIS 1M to more than 100 graduates of the programs of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel, in order to provide personal assistance to graduates who found themselves in financial difficulty due to the crisis.\n","html_content":"<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Mandel-grants.jpg\" alt=\"Mandel Foundation Grants\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<p>The COVID-19 crisis had a profound impact on the lives of the peoples of Israel.

The two-story building is designed in a manner that encourages encounters and interactions between fellows, faculty, graduates, and staff. Its classrooms are dynamic and versatile, with modular furniture that can be rearranged easily, allowing each room to have multiple functions. The building has an auditorium with some 200 seats, a courtyard with a garden named for Mort Mandel's parents, Simon and Rose Mandel, and the largest \"living roof\" in all of Israel, which is rich in native vegetation and creates an ecological continuum between the Botanical Gardens and the nearby Gazelle Valley and Nahal Refa'im.

And what is the process by which halakha is decided so as to reflect changes in the real world?<\/p><p>As a case study, the two scholars analyzed the halakhic ruling issued by a group of municipal and neighborhood rabbis who belong to the association of Maghreb rabbis in Israel, which permitted the use of the Zoom video conferencing platform on the night of the Passover Seder. This dispensation was given in response to a question from someone who wanted to prevent elderly members of his family from spending the Seder night alone due to the strict social distancing restrictions imposed by the Israeli Ministry of Health.<\/p><p> \u201cHow can it be that a certain halakhic issue may be the subject of different, even contradictory, rulings?\u201d Malka Puterkovsky asked Rabbi Menachem. \u201cAnd what is your halakhic approach to situations in which human distress comes up against a halakhic prohibition?\u201d<\/p><p> \u201cA serious halakhic decisor does all he can in order to include the person who is asking the question in the halakhic deliberation.

Rabbi Menachem concluded by quoting Rabbi Yitzchak Hutner: \u201cWhen there is a situation of dispute, \u2018these and those\u2019 are the living words of God.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>About the participants<\/h4>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rabbi David Menachem<\/strong> is a community rabbi, halakhic scholar, Biblical interpreter, cantor, singer, and composer of piyyutim, who is prominently involved in the development of Israeli culture.<\/p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Malka Puterkovsky<\/strong> is a halakhic scholar and educator who combines traditional Jewish sources in a variety of ways in order to provide responses to individual and public challenges in the State of Israel.<\/p>\n<br>\n","images":{"malka-zoom-en.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Malka-zoom-en.jpg","caption":""}},"attachments":[],"outer_links":[]},"commander-educators-in-idf-and-palmach":{"title":"Commander-Educators in the Palmach and the IDF","date":"2020-04-27","image":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/IDF-joint-day-Palmach_s.jpg","excerpt":"To mark Israel's Memorial Day, the Mandel IDF Educational Leadership Program held a virtual seminar with the Palmach Museum\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Commander-educators-in-IDF-and-Palmach.aspx","is_inner":"yes","slug":"commander-educators-in-idf-and-palmach","text":"At a seminar held on the day before Yom Hazikaron, Israel's Memorial Day for Fallen Soldiers, the fellows of the Mandel IDF Educational Leadership Program learned about different aspects of leadership displayed by commanders in the Palmach, (the elite strike force of the Haganah, the military defense force of the Jewish Yishuv in pre-State Israel), and explored how those aspects of leadership have shaped concepts of command and leadership in the IDF.\nThe seminar was opened by Shiri Erlich-Parasol, director of the Palmach Museum, who presented the historical background that led to the establishment of the Palmach and discussed the founding principles of the philosophy of leadership developed by its early commanders.\nMajor General (ret.)

The speakers discussed a variety of questions relating to Ramadan, such as: Why do Muslims fast? Why does the fast last an entire month? What are the ideas and values behind the fast? What is the universal message of Ramadan?\n\u201cRamadan is a perfume. You douse yourself in it and it is supposed to stay with you. A fast is renewable energy that is meant to last for the whole year,\u201d said Dr. Agbaria, the moderator of the session, in his opening statement. \u201cThe practice of fasting is an ancient human technology. It is a technology of the self, through which we try to organize and discipline\u2026 our lusts, wants, and desires. It\u2019s a technology for working on yourself\u2026. All civilizations share this foundational practice of abstinence, retreat, and restraint.\u201d\nQadi Muhammad Rashid Zibda emphasized the essence of the fast as being the awe of the divine presence, and the desire of the believer to receive God\u2019s love through fasting, which is one of the five pillars of Islam. \u201cThe fast is a religious obligation; however, its purpose is not to burden the believer but rather to benefit mankind as a whole. The month of Ramadan is a time for doing many good deeds and for bringing joy to others. This is a special time of year, for it is the month in which the Quran was handed down from heaven to the prophet Muhammad. The fast is not a goal in itself, but rather a means for cleansing one\u2019s soul, for reviving the humanity that is within all of us, which is worn down during our daily grind, and for habituating us to be good and kind to others: our families, those around us, and all of mankind,\u201d he explained.\n\n\nDr. Arin Salamah-Qudsi chose to focus on the concept of introspection in the psychology of the Islamic mystical denomination known as Sufism, which emerged at the end of the eighth century in Iraq and Persia, and which takes an ascetic approach to Islam. As she explained it, at the heart of the Sufi experience is the aspiration to draw closer to God, with the aim of achieving total unity with the divine. This is the true purpose of the fast, which is the peak of an ongoing process of emotional restraint.

The speakers discussed a variety of questions relating to Ramadan, such as: Why do Muslims fast? Why does the fast last an entire month? What are the ideas and values behind the fast? What is the universal message of Ramadan?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRamadan is a perfume. You douse yourself in it and it is supposed to stay with you. A fast is renewable energy that is meant to last for the whole year,\u201d said <strong>Dr. Agbaria<\/strong>, the moderator of the session, in his opening statement. \u201cThe practice of fasting is an ancient human technology. It is a technology of the self, through which we try to organize and discipline\u2026 our lusts, wants, and desires. It\u2019s a technology for working on yourself\u2026. All civilizations share this foundational practice of abstinence, retreat, and restraint.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Qadi Muhammad Rashid Zibda<\/strong> emphasized the essence of the fast as being the awe of the divine presence, and the desire of the believer to receive God\u2019s love through fasting, which is one of the five pillars of Islam. \u201cThe fast is a religious obligation; however, its purpose is not to burden the believer but rather to benefit mankind as a whole. The month of Ramadan is a time for doing many good deeds and for bringing joy to others. This is a special time of year, for it is the month in which the Quran was handed down from heaven to the prophet Muhammad. The fast is not a goal in itself, but rather a means for cleansing one\u2019s soul, for reviving the humanity that is within all of us, which is worn down during our daily grind, and for habituating us to be good and kind to others: our families, those around us, and all of mankind,\u201d he explained.<br><br><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\">\n   <iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/NPHUi3H7o2w?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><br><\/div>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Dr. Arin Salamah-Qudsi<\/strong> chose to focus on the concept of introspection in the psychology of the Islamic mystical denomination known as Sufism, which emerged at the end of the eighth century in Iraq and Persia, and which takes an ascetic approach to Islam. As she explained it, at the heart of the Sufi experience is the aspiration to draw closer to God, with the aim of achieving total unity with the divine. This is the true purpose of the fast, which is the peak of an ongoing process of emotional restraint. The fast is an uncompromising war with our ego and desires, such that it is transformed from an obstacle to be overcome to the realization of this ultimate goal. \u201cThe fast is a commandment that exists solely between man and God, for it has no external expression.

Addressing the well-wishers assembled in Jerusalem with great excitement, he said: \"This is going to be a magnificent building. It's hopefully going to do wonderful things for the people of Israel\u2026. To sit here and see this is more than a dream come true. It's a tribute to the people with whom I grew up. To my father, to my mother.\" Mr. Mandel related that he and his two brothers, who predeceased him, always carried with them an awareness of the approval of their mother, who had taught them the importance of giving. \"You know what I'm thinking when I'm sitting here?\" he added emotionally, \"Mom would have loved this.\" Following his words, the guests in attendance sang \"Happy Birthday,\" in honor of his 98th birthday.<\/p>\n<p>\"This building will be one of the most important buildings in the city, in terms of the importance of the activities that will take place in it,\" said Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion. \"We in Jerusalem are grateful to the Foundation and its leadership for its long-standing contribution in the areas of education, leadership, society, and the spirit of Jerusalem.\"<\/p>\n<p>The official inauguration of the new building of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation in Jerusalem is scheduled for May 2020.<br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\"> \n   <iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/cIJh6AGn1j0?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>&nbsp;<\/div>\n<br>\n","images":{"pre-opening-19-9-2019.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/pre-opening-19-9-2019.jpg","caption":""}},"attachments":[],"outer_links":[]},"yeruham-ceremony-2019":{"title":"Mandel Innovation Center Building Inaugurated in Yeruham","date":"2019-09-16","image":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Yeruham-Center_s.jpg","excerpt":"The Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Center for Innovation in Yeruham will be the home of the MindCET EdTech innovation center \u00a0","link":"https:\/\/www.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Yeruham-Ceremony-2019.aspx","is_inner":"yes","slug":"yeruham-ceremony-2019","text":"\u00a0\nThe new home of MindCET, a center for innovation and technological development in education founded by the Center for Educational Technology \u2013 CET, was inaugurated in the Negev city of Yeruham on September 16, 2019.

The space will also be open to soldiers and officers from the IDF\u2019s new training campus, and to hi-tech professionals from across the Negev. The Sandbox \u2013 A space that will display groundbreaking technologies in the field of EdTech (educational technology) and that will enable visitors to try them out. The space will host workshops and will serve as a setting for individual learning by teachers, soldiers, and technology professionals. Fab Lab \u2013 A makerspace that will combine a traditional workshop with programming, 3-D printing, and laser-cutting facilities, enabling students, teachers, and entrepreneurs to create almost anything they can imagine. The lab will serve groups from the IDF\u2019s new training campus, and youth from Yeruham and from nearby Bedouin settlements. The Flying Classroom \u2013 A classroom devoted to research experiments, which will contain technological aids for researchers (built-in recording and documentation devices, a one-way observation window, sensors, and observation points). A research wing with classrooms and a hall, for use by the different groups that will participate in MindCET activities, and also for conferences and training sessions for school faculties, opinion makers, officers from the IDF training campus, and fellows and graduates of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership.\n\u00a0\nIn addition to the above, each year, MindCET will host an international educational technology forum named for Morton L.

He stressed that Mr. Mandel invests not only money, but also himself in all of the projects that he supports, paying attention to every detail that concerns them. \"In addition to the Mandel Foundation's interest in Israel in general,\" he asserted, \"we have a particular interested in the Negev.

The new Center builds on and expands the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Program for Humanities in Engineering pioneered at TAU in 2016.
