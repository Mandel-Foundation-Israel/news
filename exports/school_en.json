Moshe Vigdor, director general of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel, described Danny as \u201can educator, an educational leader, a teacher, an instructor, a guide, a man of vision, a man of action, a family man, and a humanist. When I look at Danny\u2019s qualities,\u201d he added, \u201cI see fairness, loyalty, honesty, understanding, maturity, wisdom \u2013 wisdom of the heart and wisdom of action \u2013 as well as patience, and inclusiveness.\u201d\nEster Dana Shauli, Danny\u2019s personal assistant, who worked with him from his first day at the School, thanked Danny for his sensitivity as a manager and for the fact that his door was always open.\n\u201cWe learned from you, as a person, about humanity and attentiveness, about the power of words and the need to be precise with them,\u201d said Lior Journo and Reut Shalev, graduates of Cohort 30. \u201cWe learned about your smile and calmness, which influenced us all. We learned from you, as an educator, about making the person you are talking to feel that they are the entire world. We learned from you, as a manager, that it is possible to lead quietly and to resolve disagreements amicably. You instilled confidence in us; we knew that we could trust you. Beyond that, you made room for the expression and influence of all those around you.\u201d\n\u201cIn his opening remarks at the beginning of the year at the School, Professor Meir Buzaglo listed the conditions that enable the existence of ideological leadership,\u201d they continued. \u201cHe spoke with us about independence and the ability to break away from dependence, about not seeking out recognition for action, and about the ability to be content with a small but significant change in the world. When he spoke to us, we thought about you: an ideological leader who does not give up the independence that enables him to be true to his principles, who does not expect recognition, who is not looking for fireworks, and for whom even a small change in the world is worthy, as long as it comes from within and is in the right direction. These traits enable you to be an ideological leader who influences his environment and is always involved in values clarification and constant change. Your imprint will remain within the walls of this institution, and more importantly, within the scores of graduates over the past decade\u2026. The fact that you are embarking on a new path from a place of such stability and wholeness is an inspiration to us.\u201d\n\u201cDanny, with his personality and style, educates us to a different state of consciousness: a state of adaptation, patience, modesty, and an avoidance of the arrogant belief that one can control people and engineer everything,\u201d said Professor Ayman Agbaria, a faculty member of the Mandel School of Educational Leadership. \u201cDespite his vast experience in large-scale, system-wide management of large institutions, he knows how to be non-institutional. He succeeded in not being a bureaucrat because he perfected a method of slowing time down as a way of a life, and not as a means of control,\u201d Agbaria continued. \u201cI once wrote to you that you were our leader, without grandiose ideas or plans and without feigned caring. You were our leader. With the inspiration, calm, inclusiveness, openness, and commitment that you created for us and instilled in us in the School, you were our leader. We are bidding you farewell this evening, and we are happy for you that you are embarking on a new path,\u201d Agbaria said.\n\u201cWhen things are stormy and unstable, people search for safe ground on which to rest their feet and their souls,\u201d Danny responded from the podium. \u201cThe first thing that I want to say to you is: be an island unto yourselves. Be an island for yourselves so that you can be an island for others. Devote time to self-care. This has always been important, and today more than ever. My second point is related to education: The best way to be prepared for storms is to deepen roots and strengthen foundations. Go back to the big questions, to the depths, to the meaning of our existence, to the great traditions, and to questions of identity. I hope for all of us that movements such as The Spirit of Man in Education and Slow Education will set the tone and mark the path for the educational system in the coming years.\n\u201cThe years in which I was the director of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership were very meaningful for me,\u201d he continued. \u201cEver since I left my position as a high-school principal, in every staff position that I held, I saw the world of education through conference rooms and computer screens. I paid a heavy personal price. Returning to Mandel was an exciting and fascinating return to human encounters and unmediated contact with the fellows. I directed the school for a decade, and accompanied some two hundred fellows. It seems to me that I had an influence on at least some of them, and succeeded in touching their souls, and maybe even contributed a bit to their work in the world.\u201d\nAt the end of the evening, Danny thanked those who had worked alongside him during the years that he directed the School: the faculty members, the fellows, the staff, and Ester Dana Shauli and Maya Barak, who supported him in his work. \u201cI thank the director general of the Foundation and the president and CEO Jehuda Reinharz.

When I look at Danny\u2019s qualities,\u201d he added, \u201cI see fairness, loyalty, honesty, understanding, maturity, wisdom \u2013 wisdom of the heart and wisdom of action \u2013 as well as patience, and inclusiveness.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ester Dana Shauli<\/strong>, Danny\u2019s personal assistant, who worked with him from his first day at the School, thanked Danny for his sensitivity as a manager and for the fact that his door was always open.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe learned from you, as a person, about humanity and attentiveness, about the power of words and the need to be precise with them,\u201d said <strong>Lior Journo<\/strong> and <strong>Reut Shalev<\/strong>, graduates of Cohort 30. \u201cWe learned about your smile and calmness, which influenced us all. We learned from you, as an educator, about making the person you are talking to feel that they are the entire world. We learned from you, as a manager, that it is possible to lead quietly and to resolve disagreements amicably. You instilled confidence in us; we knew that we could trust you. Beyond that, you made room for the expression and influence of all those around you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn his opening remarks at the beginning of the year at the School, Professor Meir Buzaglo listed the conditions that enable the existence of ideological leadership,\u201d they continued. \u201cHe spoke with us about independence and the ability to break away from dependence, about not seeking out recognition for action, and about the ability to be content with a small but significant change in the world. When he spoke to us, we thought about you: an ideological leader who does not give up the independence that enables him to be true to his principles, who does not expect recognition, who is not looking for fireworks, and for whom even a small change in the world is worthy, as long as it comes from within and is in the right direction. These traits enable you to be an ideological leader who influences his environment and is always involved in values clarification and constant change. Your imprint will remain within the walls of this institution, and more importantly, within the scores of graduates over the past decade\u2026. The fact that you are embarking on a new path from a place of such stability and wholeness is an inspiration to us.\u201d<br><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Danny-1.jpg\" alt=\"A musical performance at the farewell evening (Photo: Naveh Ben Shmuel)\" style=\"margin:5px;\"><br><\/p>\n<p><br>\u201cDanny, with his personality and style, educates us to a different state of consciousness: a state of adaptation, patience, modesty, and an avoidance of the arrogant belief that one can control people and engineer everything,\u201d said <strong>Professor Ayman Agbaria<\/strong>, a faculty member of the Mandel School of Educational Leadership. \u201cDespite his vast experience in large-scale, system-wide management of large institutions, he knows how to be non-institutional. He succeeded in not being a bureaucrat because he perfected a method of slowing time down as a way of a life, and not as a means of control,\u201d Agbaria continued. \u201cI once wrote to you that you were our leader, without grandiose ideas or plans and without feigned caring. You were our leader. With the inspiration, calm, inclusiveness, openness, and commitment that you created for us and instilled in us in the School, you were our leader. We are bidding you farewell this evening, and we are happy for you that you are embarking on a new path,\u201d Agbaria said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen things are stormy and unstable, people search for safe ground on which to rest their feet and their souls,\u201d Danny responded from the podium. \u201cThe first thing that I want to say to you is: be an island unto yourselves. Be an island for yourselves so that you can be an island for others. Devote time to self-care. This has always been important, and today more than ever. My second point is related to education: The best way to be prepared for storms is to deepen roots and strengthen foundations. Go back to the big questions, to the depths, to the meaning of our existence, to the great traditions, and to questions of identity. I hope for all of us that movements such as The Spirit of Man in Education and Slow Education will set the tone and mark the path for the educational system in the coming years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe years in which I was the director of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership were very meaningful for me,\u201d he continued. \u201cEver since I left my position as a high-school principal, in every staff position that I held, I saw the world of education through conference rooms and computer screens. I paid a heavy personal price. Returning to Mandel was an exciting and fascinating return to human encounters and unmediated contact with the fellows. I directed the school for a decade, and accompanied some two hundred fellows. It seems to me that I had an influence on at least some of them, and succeeded in touching their souls, and maybe even contributed a bit to their work in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the evening, Danny thanked those who had worked alongside him during the years that he directed the School: the faculty members, the fellows, the staff, and <strong>Ester Dana Shauli <\/strong>and <strong>Maya Barak<\/strong>, who supported him in his work. \u201cI thank the director general of the Foundation and the president and CEO <strong>Jehuda Reinharz<\/strong>. A final word of thanks is given to <strong>Mort Mandel<\/strong>, of blessed memory, for the great privilege of working with him. Mort was an inspiring man. I learned a great deal from him about generosity, professionalism, and how important it is to dream big.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The entire Mandel community hopes that Danny will continue in his work \u2014 both as an educator and as a humanist.<br><\/p>\n","images":{"danny-2.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Danny-2.jpg","caption":""},"danny-1.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Danny-1.jpg","caption":""}},"attachments":[],"outer_links":[]},"products-29-2022-aspx":{"title":"Fellows of Cohort 29 Present Their Final Studies","date":"2022-07-04","image":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/MSEL-Products-29_s.jpg","excerpt":"The graduating fellows of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership presented the products of their two-year program of study\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Products-29-2022-aspx.aspx","is_inner":"yes","slug":"products-29-2022-aspx","text":"\u200bOver the course of two intensive days, the 22 fellows of Cohort 29 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership presented their final studies\u00a0\u2013 the fruit of two years of intensive education at the School.

Raya also lectured, tutored fellows, and developed content and pedagogies in the fields of group wellbeing, leadership, and management, and\u00a0was an instructor in the Mandel Program for Academic Leadership in Teacher Education. Beyond her work at Mandel, she also served as a consultant and facilitator in a variety of management and leadership development programs, including the Civil Service Cadet program.\nRaya completed her doctorate in social work at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Alongside her studies in family therapy and research into the life stories of couples who used divorce mediation, she worked as a mediator with families dealing with the hardships of divorce and the changes it brings. Over the course of her theoretical and practical research, Raya came to adopt the narrative approach, which she applied in both her professional and personal life.\nFor many years, Raya guided managers, entrepreneurs, and professionals through processes of change, formulating their professional identities, and developing an organizational vision based on their own personal vision. Alongside her practice at her clinic, Raya also developed a master\u2019s degree course at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem that examines the connection between organizational and personal vision, and studies the stories of visionary leaders.\nRaya worked with the IDF on developing and supporting officers as part of the \"Raful Boys\" project. She was also a member of the academic faculty of the David Yellin College of Education, where she lectured in the adult education department, directed the institute for guiding parents\u2019 groups, and served as head of the training program for school principals. Over the last decade, based on her years of experience in consulting and leadership development, Raya developed and led programs for developing managerial and leadership skills.\nIn her book Own Your Story, published in 2017, Raya presents the unique method she developed for coping with challenges relating to mid-life career change by examining one\u2019s personal narrative. Following the book\u2019s considerable impact, Raya developed various training courses based on the Own Your Story approach, to spread the word and develop this field of practice.\nThe Mandel School and the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel extend our sincere condolences to Raya\u2019s husband Zvi and their four children, Roni, Chen, Adi, and Doron.\nFollowing is the eulogy for Raya delivered by Danny Bar Giora, director of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership:\nOur dear and beloved Raya,\nAlthough you prepared me in advance, when we met for the last time about ten days ago, and you asked me to give a eulogy, I couldn\u2019t begin to think about it until I received the bitter news on Friday.\nAt that last meeting of ours, you told me \u2013 with an inner strength that I have not often encountered in my life \u2013 about your process of leave-taking, and how you would like us to take our leave of you, and the role you wanted me to play in that process. After we had gone over that, we spoke about the complex processes affecting the Mandel Foundation and some of the fellows and faculty members. You were concerned about them, you asked how they were doing, and you were concerned about me. Without saying so explicitly, you gave me another lesson in reading people, and of course, you sent me off with a list of assignments.\n\u201dWarning! Addictive substance!\u201d That was how I often thought of you, and that was the sign I thought should be hung on your door, so that anyone coming in would know that they would find it hard to kick the habit.\nMuch has been said and written about the magic of meeting with you. I myself had the privilege of experiencing that magic as someone who followed your work as tutor at the Mandel School for Educational Leadership. Over the years, I have also witnessed the impact of that magic on many fellows and graduates.\nYou always packaged everything in narrative concepts, Raya, but I would like to say something about the wisdom of simplicity \u2013 even the genius of simplicity \u2013 that I saw in you: the simplicity of seeing people.\nYou weren\u2019t full of yourself, and as a result, you could make room for whoever you were meeting with.\nYou weren\u2019t prejudiced or judgmental, and as a result, you could see whoever was with you as they really are.\nYou didn\u2019t see what you know; you wanted to know what you saw.\nYou weren\u2019t concerned with yourself; you genuinely cared about the people you met with, and you always sought to ensure that their needs were met. You never tried to fulfill your own needs via the people you met with.\nYou stayed true to yourself, and weren\u2019t swayed by trends or by pretty but empty words.\nAbove all, you had a love of your fellow human beings, and a rare ability to read their hearts and minds.\nAnd all this simplicity\u2026 If only more people would have it, the world would be a better place. But even if it was, the world would be a worse place now that you\u2019re not in it.\nI want to share with you some of the challenges of working with Raya:\nBecause so many fellows wanted Raya to be their individual tutor, we had to invent the concept of \u201cshort-term tutoring\u201d and take Raya out of the roster of year-long tutors. This allowed many more fellows to have time with her. That, of course, didn\u2019t stop a considerable number of fellows from asking for short-term tutoring with Raya all the time\u2026.\nRaya also met with graduates and was part of the team that decided when graduates should receive consulting and what type of consulting they should get. We had all kinds of categories of consulting (professional crossroads, identity clarification, leading change, etc.). And then there was a special consulting category:\u00a0 Raya consulting. You have no idea how many graduates said that what they wanted was Raya: \u201cYou can call it whatever you like,\u201d they said, \u201cas long as the end result is meetings with Raya, because she is the only one who can help us understand what we really need.\u201d\nTogether with Daniel Marom, Raya developed the entire field of individual tutoring at the Mandel School and ran it until recently. She also facilitated fellows\u2019 workshops and was involved in developing study units, including management stories, management workshops, supporting fellows in the transition back into the world of work, and more. She also led all the dynamic work in fellows\u2019 work groups.\u00a0Raya taught in other Mandel programs, and tutored and mentored many faculty members and fellows.\nWith that same wisdom of simplicity that I spoke about earlier, Raya was my confidant, a vital and close partner during the challenging moments and junctures of directing the Mandel School for Educational Leadership. We often spoke about the fact that it was a unique experience to be able to contain two narratives simultaneously \u2013 the narrative of my being Raya\u2019s manager while she was a faculty member, while she was my mentor and advisor at the same time.\nAnd in the endThe love you takeIs equal to the loveYou make\nDear Raya, the amount of love that the world is giving back to you is inconceivable. As I stand here, I am giving back \u2018only\u2019 the love of many fellows and graduates, and of course, of many faculty and staff members. This love alone would be enough to support an entire village.\nWe all carry a little piece of you inside us, Raya, and in that way will continue your influence on the world.\nI am here today as a representative of the entire Mandel Foundation, and take my leave from you in the name of the Foundation\u2019s management, employees, faculty members, fellows, and graduates.\u00a0\nMuch love and thanks on behalf of us all.And my own personal love and thanks.Go in peace, dearest Raya.\n","html_content":"<p>\u200bDr. Raya Yoeli joined the faculty of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership in 2008.

We had all kinds of categories of consulting (professional crossroads, identity clarification, leading change, etc.). And then there was a special consulting category:&nbsp; Raya consulting. You have no idea how many graduates said that what they wanted was Raya: \u201cYou can call it whatever you like,\u201d they said, \u201cas long as the end result is meetings with Raya, because she is the only one who can help us understand what we really need.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\n      <em>Together with Daniel Marom, Raya developed the entire field of individual tutoring at the Mandel School and ran it until recently. She also facilitated fellows\u2019 workshops and was involved in developing study units, including management stories, management workshops, supporting fellows in the transition back into the world of work, and more. She also led all the dynamic work in fellows\u2019 work groups.&nbsp;Raya taught in other Mandel programs, and tutored and mentored many faculty members and fellows.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\n      <em>With that same wisdom of simplicity that I spoke about earlier, Raya was my confidant, a vital and close partner during the challenging moments and junctures of directing the Mandel School for Educational Leadership.

As part of the exercise, the fellows of Cohort 29 spent around a month researching the implementation of Israel\u2019s special education law, to which a major amendment was introduced in 2018 with the aim of advancing the integration and inclusion of children with special needs in regular schools. (Prior to that, children with special needs were almost always segregated in special education schools). The recommendations that emerged from their research were presented at an event held at the Mandel School on February 8, 2022.\nDuring the exercise, the fellows engaged in a process of in-depth learning that included study of research literature, field trips to educational institutions, and review of relevant reports and documents. They also conducted dozens of interviews with officials in positions relevant to inclusion and integration in the education system, including chairs of eligibility committees, senior managers in the Ministry of Education, parents, inclusion assistants, school principals, teachers, and leaders of civil society organizations working to advance the rights of people with disabilities. At the conclusion of this learning process, the fellows presented their recommendations in a document that was presented to the various stakeholders.\nThe recommendations were based on the principle that regular schools must be strengthened in order to serve as inclusive educational institutions that have optimal systemic capability to provide excellent educational services to all children, including children with special needs. The fellows formulated the following main recommendations to achieve this goal:\nThe recommendations were presented at an event attended by Dalit Stauber, the director general of the Ministry of Education; Professor Jehuda Reinharz, the president and CEO of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation; Moshe Vigdor, director general of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel; Yoav Zimran, the head of the Jerusalem Education Administration; and Miri Navon, the senior director of the Ministry of Education\u2019s division for the implementation of Israel\u2019s inclusion and integration reform.\n\nDanny Bar Giora, director of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, spoke about the topic chosen for the group exercise and about the fellows\u2019 work during their intensive month of study: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the issue of inclusion is very close to my heart.

Dear fellows, you have made a very clear statement, that the school is the central and most important arena [for inclusion] that must be strengthened and supported, and I, of course, completely agree with you on this.\u201d In conclusion, Danny thanked the representatives of the Ministry of Education, the Jerusalem Education Administration, and all their staff members, who opened doors and enabled the fellows of Cohort 29 to participate in a meaningful process of re-examining the implementation of the amendment to the Special Education Law.\nDalit Stauber, director general of the Ministry of Education and former faculty member of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, responded to the booklet of recommendations produced by the fellows as follows: \u201cWhen I read the document that Danny sent me, the Mandel DNA could be seen immediately: it contains a vision, research-based learning, and translation into practice. This DNA will continue to serve you wherever you go.\u201d Regarding the recommendations themselves, she added: \u201cYou have analyzed the problems and you proposed solutions that I am embracing warmly.

The process of designing the trip was led jointly by faculty member Dr. Lia Ettinger and longstanding tutor Vered Livne.\nThe main purpose of the two-day study tour, held in November 2021, was to bring the fellows face-to-face with the seriousness of the climate crisis and with various dilemmas related to how to address it. Through visits to power plants, waste handling facilities, and agricultural centers and initiatives, the fellows learned about possible solutions to challenges, and about the social, economic, political, ethical, and educational questions presented by the climate crisis.

There they learned about methods of producing electricity from fossil fuels and from renewable energies, and, more importantly, about the challenges involved in transitioning from the former to the latter. They also toured the Veridis waste sorting facility in Afula, where they learned about the connection between waste and the climate crisis. In Moshav Hayogev, they met with farmers and entrepreneurs who are advancing various kinds of sustainable agriculture.

This insight is based on the clear understanding that the climate crisis is one of the main challenges we will all have to address, now and in the foreseeable future.\nStudy tours are held twice a year as part of the program of study at the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, in the fall and in the spring, and they examine changing themes. The trips introduce fellows to educational and social leaders and their work, and enable fellows to improve their powers of observation and conceptualization skills. The trips also serve as an extension of the curriculum, broadening and deepening the fellows\u2019 knowledge in key areas.\nThe study tours are designed and implemented in collaboration with a team of fellows who volunteer for the task.

The poster is the culmination of a process in which fellows hone and refine their areas of interest, and clarify the principles and values they aim to promote in their future work in education. The poster also gives fellows an opportunity to gain\u00a0experience in translating texts into visual language, and showcases their areas of interest to the broader community of the School and of\u00a0the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel, so that its members can become active partners with the fellows during their second year of study and beyond.\nOn October 25, 2021, the fellows of Cohort 29 presented their posters to faculty members, the fellows\u2019 personal tutors, the fellows of cohort 30, and representatives of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel. During the fellows\u2019 planning of the event, three main themes emerged as prominent in their areas of interest: (1) the act of education \u2013 identity and values; (2) men and women educators \u2013 humanity and growth; and (3) social change engines.\n\n\nAt the event, a series of brief presentations by the fellows were followed by personal conversations in which the presenters discussed the challenges they had identified. The audience also played an active role in the event, as its members shared their ideas for the future, and their thoughts about the areas of interest from the perspectives of policymakers, policy implementers, and the target populations. They also considered both theoretical and practical aspects of the ideas presented.\nDanny Bar Giora, director of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, congratulated the fellows of Cohort 29 on their poster presentations and explained the importance of their declaration of their intentions: \u201cThe poster presentation is a statement of intent to the broader community of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership regarding the area you seek to engage in and influence,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition, this is a wonderful exercise in visual language, in the art of conciseness, and in precise wording.\u201d\nFaculty member Dr. Neta Sher-Hadar, who led the poster design process with the assistance of Gili Stern, the School\u2019s digital learning coordinator, spoke about the important work process that the fellows had participated in during the weeks leading up to the poster presentations. This process involved many partners\u00a0who were involved in discussions and consultations, both before and after the poster presentation itself. The process also sought to deepen the fellows\u2019 learning in their areas of interest, and to help them explore possible ways to implement their ideas. \u201cEach poster and every declaration of intent expresses an entire world of values and proposes a direction of action, or at least the beginnings of one,\u201d she said.\nFollowing the poster presentation, the fellows began working on translating their studies into actions that will have significant impact on their chosen area of practice.\nClick here to view the posters of Cohort 29 online (Hebrew) >>\n\nBy Sharon Wasserman\n\u201cDancing is the hidden language of the soul,\u201d according to American dancer and choreographer Martha Graham. As someone who began dancing at the age of eight, but long ago gave up the dream of dancing with the Batsheva Dance Company, dancing has always given me the ultimate connection between body and soul. It is a zone in which thoughts have their place, but are also silenced when necessary; an area in which I can rely on the known and familiar in my body, but also try new things, dare, deal with frustrations, and keep moving.\nMy name is Sharon Wasserman. I am a mother, a spouse, a law graduate, and an educator working to advance equal opportunities in education, who recognizes the significant and unique contribution made by teachers to this goal. It is the experience of movement in dance that I want to apply to the personal and professional development process that I plan to make available to teachers throughout their professional careers.\nThe \u201csignature pedagogies\u201d [the ways in which future practitioners are educated to think, perform and act with integrity in their new professions in the same way professionals in their field would] described by Professor Lee Shulman comprise habits of the mind, habits of the hand, and habits of the heart.

The poster is the culmination of a process in which fellows hone and refine their areas of interest, and clarify the principles and values they aim to promote in their future work in education. The poster also gives fellows an opportunity to gain&nbsp;experience in translating texts into visual language, and showcases their areas of interest to the broader community of the School and of&nbsp;the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel, so that its members can become active partners with the fellows during their second year of study and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>On October 25, 2021, the fellows of Cohort 29 presented their posters to faculty members, the fellows\u2019 personal tutors, the fellows of cohort 30, and representatives of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel. During the fellows\u2019 planning of the event, three main themes emerged as prominent in their areas of interest: (1) the act of education \u2013 identity and values; (2) men and women educators \u2013 humanity and growth; and (3) social change engines.<br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n<p> \n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/MSEL-posters-29-4.jpg\" alt=\"The posters (Photo: Naveh Ben Shmuel\" class=\"img-responsive\"> \n   <span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Photo: Naveh Ben Shmuel<\/span><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>\n   <br>At the event, a series of brief presentations by the fellows were followed by personal conversations in which the presenters discussed the challenges they had identified.

This process involved many partners&nbsp;who were involved in discussions and consultations, both before and after the poster presentation itself. The process also sought to deepen the fellows\u2019 learning in their areas of interest, and to help them explore possible ways to implement their ideas. \u201cEach poster and every declaration of intent expresses an entire world of values and proposes a direction of action, or at least the beginnings of one,\u201d she said.<br><\/p>\n<p>Following the poster presentation, the fellows began working on translating their studies into actions that will have significant impact on their chosen area of practice. <\/p>\n<p> \n   <a href=\"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/Fellows\/Projects\/Cohort_29\/index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <strong>Click here to view the posters of Cohort 29 online (Hebrew) &gt;&gt;<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p> \n      <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/MSEL-posters-29-5.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Wasserman presenting her poster (Photo: Naveh Ben Shmuel)\" class=\"img-responsive\"> \n      <span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Sharon Wasserman presenting her poster (Photo: Naveh Ben Shmuel)<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p> \n      <strong>By Sharon Wasserman<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cDancing is the hidden language of the soul,\u201d according to American dancer and choreographer Martha Graham. As someone who began dancing at the age of eight, but long ago gave up the dream of dancing with the Batsheva Dance Company, dancing has always given me the ultimate connection between body and soul.

I am a mother, a spouse, a law graduate, and an educator working to advance equal opportunities in education, who recognizes the significant and unique contribution made by teachers to this goal.

and educational worldview. Under his leadership, the unit built trust and promoted teamwork, collaboration, and collegiality among fellows and faculty. His managerial style was to support his staff behind the scenes,\u00a0while initiating profound changes in infrastructure\u00a0with an approach that is both practical and meticulous.\nUnder Professor Adler's leadership, the Mandel School's education unit expanded and became a collaborative unit in which all faculty members could express their own ideas and worldviews. Curricular components and activities were integrated and consolidated into a holistic course with its own internal logic under the umbrella of the education unit. Steps were taken to involve the fellows in developing the curriculum and to offer them greater choice and independence in planning and studying the educational issues of interest to them. These efforts transformed the School's education unit into a leading, groundbreaking unit that contributed to and influenced the development of many educational initiatives established by fellows and graduates.\nProfessor Adler continued this important work, as well as his dedicated personal mentoring of fellows at the School, in his role as an advisor and senior faculty member of the Mandel Graduate Unit, which began in 2003. In this capacity, he provided personal consultations to graduates in the field, helping them with personal, professional, and pedagogical dilemmas and providing them with guidance at decision-making junctures. He maintained warm, personal relationships with many of the fellows he guided and the graduates he advised. Through them, his educational philosophy continues to spread light in the world.\nChaim Adler completed a master\u2019s degree in sociology and education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he also completed a doctorate in education, with research focusing on high school dropouts. In 1966, he joined the faculty of the Hebrew University, where he worked until his retirement, and served thereafter as professor emeritus of education. From 1969 to 1992, he headed the sociology of education track at the Hebrew University School of Education. In 1968, Professor Seymour Fox, founder of the Research Institute for Innovation in Education, invited him to direct the Institute. He spent the next two decades directing the Institute, where he researched ways of advancing vulnerable groups in society, from early childhood education through adult education, and developed programs that were implemented in educational settings in Israel and around the world.\nIn 1975, Professor Adler was a founding partner of the Manof youth village for marginalized youth. From then until his death, he chaired the village\u2019s non-profit association. His various public positions over the years included chairing numerous committees on disengaged and at-risk youth, immigrant absorption, secondary education, non-formal education, and more.\nIn 1992, Chaim Adler was appointed director of the Hebrew University School of Education and head of educational research at the University\u2019s Center for Social Policy Research. Over the years, he served as lecturer and visiting scholar at Harvard University, Stanford University, Rutgers University, and the University of Chicago. He also served as a member of the board of governors of the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies in Israel, and served as head of the Center's education policy program.\nChaim Adler was a pioneering researcher in the sociology of education and one of Israel\u2019s leading education researchers. His research examined education as a tool for social change, the role of education in advancing disadvantaged social groups and absorbing immigrant youth, and youth culture in the modern era. He worked tirelessly in these areas, in both the academic and practical arenas, in order to reduce social gaps through education, and his research contributed greatly to education policy in Israel. In 2006, he received the Israel Prize for Education in recognition of his many contributions to the field of education.\n","html_content":"<p>\u200b<img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Chaim-Adler.jpg\" alt=\"Professor Chaim Adler\" class=\"img-responsive\"><br><\/p>\n<p>The Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation mourns the loss of <strong>Professor Chaim Adler<\/strong>, who served as head of the education unit of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership from 1996 to 2003 and was a senior faculty member of the Mandel Graduate Unit from 2003 until his death in April, 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Professor Adler\u2019s exemplary work as head of the School\u2019s education unit reflected his character and educational worldview.

In this capacity, he provided personal consultations to graduates in the field, helping them with personal, professional, and pedagogical dilemmas and providing them with guidance at decision-making junctures. He maintained warm, personal relationships with many of the fellows he guided and the graduates he advised. Through them, his educational philosophy continues to spread light in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Chaim Adler completed a master\u2019s degree in sociology and education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he also completed a doctorate in education, with research focusing on high school dropouts. In 1966, he joined the faculty of the Hebrew University, where he worked until his retirement, and served thereafter as professor emeritus of education. From 1969 to 1992, he headed the sociology of education track at the Hebrew University School of Education. In 1968, Professor Seymour Fox, founder of the Research Institute for Innovation in Education, invited him to direct the Institute. He spent the next two decades directing the Institute, where he researched ways of advancing vulnerable groups in society, from early childhood education through adult education, and developed programs that were implemented in educational settings in Israel and around the world.<\/p>\n<p>In 1975, Professor Adler was a founding partner of the Manof youth village for marginalized youth. From then until his death, he chaired the village\u2019s non-profit association. His various public positions over the years included chairing numerous committees on disengaged and at-risk youth, immigrant absorption, secondary education, non-formal education, and more.<\/p>\n<p>In 1992, Chaim Adler was appointed director of the Hebrew University School of Education and head of educational research at the University\u2019s Center for Social Policy Research. Over the years, he served as lecturer and visiting scholar at Harvard University, Stanford University, Rutgers University, and the University of Chicago. He also served as a member of the board of governors of the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies in Israel, and served as head of the Center's education policy program.<\/p>\n<p>Chaim Adler was a pioneering researcher in the sociology of education and one of Israel\u2019s leading education researchers. His research examined education as a tool for social change, the role of education in advancing disadvantaged social groups and absorbing immigrant youth, and youth culture in the modern era. He worked tirelessly in these areas, in both the academic and practical arenas, in order to reduce social gaps through education, and his research contributed greatly to education policy in Israel. In 2006, he received the Israel Prize for Education in recognition of his many contributions to the field of education.<br><\/p>\n","images":{"chaim-adler.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Chaim-Adler.jpg","caption":""}},"attachments":[],"outer_links":[]},"msel-graduation-2020":{"title":"Cohort 27 Celebrates Graduation from Mandel School","date":"2020-12-04","image":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/MSEL-27-grad-s.jpg","excerpt":"The 2020 graduation ceremony of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership was held at the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/MSEL-graduation-2020.aspx","is_inner":"yes","slug":"msel-graduation-2020","text":"Graduates of Cohort 27 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership celebrated the completion of their two years of study in a graduation ceremony that took place in the presence of Moshe Vigdor, director-general of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel, and Danny Bar Giora, director of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership.

The first focused on achieving a balance between knowledge, skills, and values, and on the need to update these areas to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The second focused on teaching and learning that are organized around big ideas \u2013 ideas that are relevant to the lives of teachers and students, that give teachers and students meaning, and that help teachers and students answer the question, \u201cWhy are we learning?\u201d\nThe recommendations of the fellows focus on three main areas: teaching units and their implementation, Arab society, and partnerships between schools and the Pedagogical Secretariat.\nThe recommendations regarding teaching\u00a0units and their implementation relate to content development \u2013 especially in the digital realm, where special attention must be devoted to the connection between pedagogy and technology \u2013 and professional development of teachers in school settings. This focus promotes meaningful learning processes in terms of knowledge, professional approaches, and teaching practices.\nIn the area of Arab society, the fellows recommended professional development efforts in three circles of belonging: the individual-school arena, the community space, and the shared Israeli space. The fellows recommended that content should be specially adapted for each of these circles.\nThe fellows also recommended that partnerships between schools and the Pedagogical Secretariat be developed based on both geographic locations and on fields of study.

In this sense, the poster is the first step in your continuing commitment to do good in the world.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/Fellows\/Projects\/Cohort_27\/index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Click <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">here<\/span> to view the posters of the fellows of Cohort 27 (Hebrew)<\/a><br><\/strong><br><\/p>\n<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/posters-27-2019-1.jpg\" alt=\"Posters Cohort 27|Posters27\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <br>\n<\/p>\n","images":{"posters-27-2019-1.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-1.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-2.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-2.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-3.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-3.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-4.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-4.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-5.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-5.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-6.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-6.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-7.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-7.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-8.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-8.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-9.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-9.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-10.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-10.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-11.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-11.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-12.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-12.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-13.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-13.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-14.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-14.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-15.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-15.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-16.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-16.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-17.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-17.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-18.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-18.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-19.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-19.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-20.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-20.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-21.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-21.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-22.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-22.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-23.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-23.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-24.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-24.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-25.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-25.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-26.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-26.jpg","caption":""},"posters-27-2019-27.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/galleries\/Posters27\/posters-27-2019-27.jpg","caption":""}},"attachments":[],"outer_links":[{"title":"Click here to view the posters of the fellows of Cohort 27 (Hebrew)","url":"https:\/\/school.mandelfoundation.org.il\/Fellows\/Projects\/Cohort_27\/index.aspx"}]},"mandel-memorial-service-en_s":{"title":"Memorial Service for Morton L.

In his work as a faculty member at the Mandel School, he also saw interaction with fellows as his main task, one in which he invested himself fully.\nShimon laid out his educational approach in a booklet he produced at the end of his studies at the Mandel School for Educational Leadership. He based his ideas on the teachings of the Talmudic figure Rava, which see wisdom as leading to action, and action as the purpose of acquiring wisdom. Inspired by this approach, Shimon asserted that learning has the power to alter student behavior, and saw this as the main source of inspiration for religious educators.\u00a0\nShimon was mainly concerned with students who have difficulty maintaining the level of application necessary for yeshiva study, with its ideal of total immersion in Torah study, and who do not receive appropriate educational attention, which can negatively affect their behavior. \u201cIt is to these students that I have dedicated my years of study at the Mandel School for Educational Leadership,\u201d Shimon wrote. \u201cI have tried to find a way in which study can influence and mold young people, in the spirit of Rava, which differs from current approaches.\u201d\nShimon always sought creative solutions that would be inclusive of all, and always found the good in everyone.

This field has undergone many changes in recent years, in particular following the decision to transfer responsibility for funding teacher training colleges to the Planning and Budgeting Committee of Israel\u2019s Council for Higher Education, and the decision to establish a new commission to reexamine the guidelines recommended by the Ariav Commission of 2006. These two decisions provided an opportunity to consider how colleges of education can help improve education in Israel. At the request of Professor Yaara Bar-On, president of the Oranim Academic College of Education, Oranim College was chosen as a test case, which would enable examination of processes within the college, as well as their interactions with other, external bodies in the field.\nOver the course of the exercise, the fellows developed a broad understanding of the field of teacher training, focusing on the academic colleges of education. They examined different approaches to teacher training, reviewed training models in Israel and abroad, analyzed the development of teacher training in Israel, and explored some of the field\u2019s main issues \u2013 differences in professional approaches, professional identity, and developing an educational vision.\nOn March 26, 2017, the fellows presented the main elements of the findings of the exercise at an event held at the Mandel School for Educational Leadership in Jerusalem. Their presentation put forward three main recommendations for action, all based on the concept that Israel\u2019s colleges of education are the bodies entrusted with strengthening teaching as a profession.\nThe first recommendation, directed mainly toward the colleges themselves, is that there should be a greater emphasis on identity development for teachers. The second recommendation is directed at decision makers in the Council for Higher Education and the Ministry of Education, and calls for strengthening the connections between the different bodies involved in teacher training, by developing mechanisms to encourage mergers and partnerships. The third recommendation is that the Council for Higher Education should become more involved in the process of merging colleges and should provide a body of experts to support this process.\nAfter the fellows presented their findings, responses were heard from three key figures involved in teacher training in Israel: Mr. Noah Greenfeld, director of the department for teacher training at the Ministry of Education; Dr. Rivka Wadmany of the Kibbutzim College, who is a member of the Council for Higher Education and its Planning and Budgeting Committee; and Professor Yaara Bar-On, president of the Oranim Academic College of Education. The respondents were asked what they see as the best and worst possible scenarios once the education colleges fall under the auspices of the Planning and Budgeting Committee.\n\n\u201cIn my idea of paradise, the colleges of education would do what they know how to do best: provide teacher training in particular disciplines for a bachelor\u2019s degree, with an option to proceed to a master\u2019s degree, but not immediately, so that students can gain insights from their experiences in the field before they continue studying,\u201d said Professor Bar-On. \u201cOver the four years of training, the students would complete a teaching certificate in the best possible way, with a great deal of field work,\u201d she continued. \u201cAfter those four years, they will have a strong educational backbone.\u201d\nDr. Rivka Wadmany envisioned a future scenario in which colleges would merge, with fewer and stronger colleges as a result: \u201cThese colleges are happy with the mergers. They believe that combining forces and coming under the responsibility of the Planning and Budgeting Committee has made them stronger academically, administratively, and financially, has raised the status of the teaching profession, and has made the colleges into an educational powerhouse that trains teachers in best way possible,\u201d she said.\nNoah Greenfeld described the ideal scenario from his perspective: \u201cWe have left behind the B.Ed., which included academic study alongside professional training. That combination created a lot of tension. First there needs to be training in a specific discipline, and only then full professional training, with a full amount of time, with no tension, and with an enormous amount of investment,\u201d he said.\nDanny Bar Giora, the director of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, praised the report of the findings of the group exercise that was produced by the fellows: \u201cYour decision to examine the education colleges by analyzing the perspectives of management, structure, and change, as well as exploring questions of educational identity and the role of the teacher as educator, combined with the way you linked vision and practice, shows that you are educational professionals who are committed to education,\u201d he told the fellows. \u201cThis connection between the identity of the educator and questions of structure and process encapsulates almost the entire Mandel philosophy in a single stroke.\u201d\nMoshe Vigdor, director general of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel and a former director general of Israel\u2019s Council for Higher Education, described some important milestones in the process of change undergone by Israel\u2019s teacher training colleges, and congratulated the fellows on the exercise and the document that they produced: \u201cThe fellows showed a remarkable ability to cut through the complexities of the system in a short period of time and under great pressure, and illuminated the fundamental issues involved.\u201d\nThe annual group exercise of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership is an opportunity for fellows to help find solutions for a particular problem facing Israel\u2019s education system.

And what would the Ministry of Education have to do to be prepared for a possible transfer of responsibility for early childhood frameworks from the Ministry of the Economy? At the request of the Ministry of Education, the fellows of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership\u2019s 23rd cohort explored these questions in this year\u2019s group exercise. At the end of the exercise, the fellows presented a document titled \u201cEarly Childhood Education Finds Room to Grow\u201d at an event held at the school at the beginning of February.\nThe cohort 23 fellows examined three central aspects of early childhood education: the state\u2019s responsibility and role regarding preschool children; early childhood needs and the quality of the public services currently provided; and organizational and professional aspects of the current system and the expected transition. To complete the picture, a brief review was conducted of the legal and budgetary aspects of the issue.\nAs part of this work, the fellows conducted a comparison of Israel\u2019s early childhood daycare centers to other OECD countries. \u201cEarly childhood education (from birth to three years) in Israel has for years been the responsibility of the Ministry of the Economy, based on the idea that daycare centers were a means of removing barriers to women\u2019s involvement in the labor market\u2026 The possible transfer of responsibility for early childhood education to the Ministry of Education provides a good opportunity for a re-evaluation of the objectives that guide policy in this area,\u201d they wrote in the report.\nThe main claim made by the document is that, given the large socioeconomic gaps in Israel and the critical importance of early childhood for long-term individual development, there needs to be real investment in providing equal opportunities. The report therefore recommends prioritizing the improvement of the quality of early childhood daycare centers and educational frameworks, and selectively promoting access to these institutions among vulnerable populations, using socioeconomic criteria.\u200b\u200b\u200b\nMoshe Vigdor, the director-general of the Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel, opened the evening with congratulatory remarks to the cohort 23 fellows and to the school\u2019s faculty, and also conveyed the best wishes of the chairman of the Foundation, Mr. Morton Mandel, and of its president, Prof. Jehuda Reinharz.\n\u201cYour decision to examine the question of early childhood frameworks through the lens of one of our society\u2019s biggest problems - social inequality - is a values-based decision, rooted in a world view that sees the state and the public education system as having full responsibility for reducing socioeconomic gaps and creating a more just society,\u201d said Danny Bar Giora, director of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership. \u201cYou then succeeded in translating this world view into practical recommendations\u2026 This connection between vision and practice is the entire \u2018Mandelian\u2019 approach in a nutshell,\u201d he said.\n","html_content":"<p>\u200bIs it possible to improve the quality of Israel\u2019s early childhood \neducation frameworks, and if so, how?
