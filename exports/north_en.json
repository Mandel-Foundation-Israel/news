The goal of the initiative is to host cultural and social events organized around movies, creating a space in which graduates can reconnect to the spirit of Mandel in an experiential way.\nCineMandel was launched at the beginning of the 2022-2023 academic year as a pilot comprising five events. The movies shown were chosen very carefully. They were all connected to the field of humanities and reflected the Mandel Foundation\u2019s values of leadership and tolerance. In addition, they all had a connection to the north of Israel, and reflected the broad tapestry of the region\u2019s identities.\nCinema was chosen as the focus of the series because it is a narrative medium that tells a story visually. Film allows us to view others, who may be similar to us or different from us. It also brings us face-to-face with ourselves and with our emotions, whether expressed or repressed. Movies also provide us with opportunities for safe encounters with figures and identities that we do not meet every day, without making us feel exposed or putting us on the defensive, and thus put us in an optimal position to listen to others and explore their personal stories.\nThe series was spearheaded by visiting faculty member Katef Morad Salama, one of the leaders of pedagogical development at the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North and the academic consultant to its program for regional leadership, who has a background in film, and Liraz Maanit, the Center\u2019s graduate community facilitator. They realized the potential of events built around screening movies with strong, social messages combined with discussions that reflect the diversity of Mandel graduates. These events offer an exceptional opportunity to create a safe space for graduates to voice their feelings and opinions, while bonding socially. They also bring together graduates of the Foundation\u2019s different programs who live and work in the North.\nThe project began at the end of January with a screening of the movie Cinema Sabaya, Israel\u2019s Oscar submission for 2023, which focuses on a group of Jewish and Arab women who meet at a videography workshop held in the Netanya\u2013Wadi \u2019Ara area and document their lives. The screening was followed by a conversation with the director, Orit Fouks Rotem.\nIn February, the drama More Than I Deserve was shown, in the presence of the movie\u2019s director, Pini Tavger, who wrote the screenplay based on his life in Kiryat Ata as the son of a single mother. The film explores immigration from Ukraine, addressing a burning issue in Israeli society.\nThe third event was a special evening held in March, which included an iftar meal to break the Ramadan fast. Dr. Ohad Ofaz spoke about a unique program at Oranim College of Education called \u201cDialogue Through Cinema,\u201d in which Jewish and Arab students, both religious and secular, participate in intercultural dialogue and create short films together. The discussion was followed by a screening of Do You Hear the Moazin? and with a conversation with the movie's\u00a0creators, Awni Matani and Alex Roitman.\nThe fourth event, held in mid-May, was different from the others and was a family event, in which the graduates were invited to bring their children. Instead of a single movie, two episodes of the successful children\u2019s series Madrasa, produced by the Israel Broadcasting Corporation, were shown. The discussion afterward featured actors from the series.\nThe fifth and final event took place in mid-June and featured the documentary movie My Hero Brother, which follows a group of young Israelis with Down syndrome who embarked on a backpacking trek in the Himalayas, accompanied by their brothers and sisters. After the screening, there was a conversation with the director and writer, Yonatan Nir.\nAll the events were attended by dozens of graduates from different Mandel programs conducted by the Foundation\u2019s five program units, with an average of 80 graduates attending each. The events all garnered many responses that cited the importance of the event for graduates and revealed how keen the graduates are for an ongoing, meaningful relationship with the Foundation. \u201cIt was uplifting, and as usual, thought-provoking, creating a positive form of writer\u2019s envy,\u201d wrote one participant. \u201cThe most pleasing thing for me was that for more than two hours, we were able to come together, speak, listen, and share social, communal, and personal issues just like we used to.

This learning module is led by the fellows themselves. They engage in active and independent study and manage the research process from beginning to end, thus finding and developing their own connections to the North through theoretical and practical research on concrete challenges and burning issues that face the region.\nOriginally, the Northern Connection module was taught separately, as part of the curriculum of each of two programs: the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in the North and the Mandel Program for Leadership for Public Service in the North. This year, however, it was decided that the module be conducted in tandem for the fellows of the two programs. This decision was based on the understanding that while the fellows work in different fields, they operate in intersecting spheres of action and influence. Conducting the module jointly can thus enable fellows to gain a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of their respective areas of activity, strengthen their networking skills and ability to collaborate, and increase opportunities for collaboration between them in order to achieve a\u00a0significant impact on the ground.\nThe Northern Connection module consists of four subjects that serve as the focus of studies: 1) general and higher education, 2) economic development and the labor market, 3) medicine and health, and 4) local government. The fellows of the two programs work in four small teams, each of which is tasked with investigating one of the above subjects and analyzing their findings with respect to at least three of the following five concerns: 1) the unique characteristics of the North, 2) the diverse society of the North, 3) the nature of local and regional leadership in the North, 4) an exploration of the given subject over time in the North, and 5) relevant public policy.\nMuch thought was devoted to the division of the fellows into teams, with care taken to ensure that each fellow\u2019s area of research would not be in his or her field of employment. This was done to guarantee that fellows would gain different perspectives, be able to develop insights, and might be able to propose creative \u201coutside the box\u201d solutions. As part of their joint study, the fellows were also offered elective classes that could provide them with relevant support.\nThe fellows were first introduced to the module during the opening retreat of their respective programs. Later, in late November, a preparatory meeting was held for the fellows to get to know one another and receive preliminary background material for their area of study. During the next meeting, the teams defined the exact topic that they would investigate, laid out a work plan, and held online meetings with relevant people. Later in the year, the fellows will spend a day in the field, which will include interviews and meetings that will acquaint them with challenges and obstacles related to their chosen topic, while enriching their grasp of the topic and enabling them to outline relevant avenues for change and to propose practical steps for improvement.\nAt the end of the process, the teams of fellows from the two programs will present their work \u2013 including the guiding rationale, insights gained, and the action plan or policy tools they devised for addressing the various challenges they confronted \u2013 at a dedicated day-long event. Among other things, this event will afford the fellows the opportunity to receive feedback from their peers, the program faculty, and outside professionals and experts who will be invited to the event.\nIn the Mandel Program for Social Leadership in the North, \u201clearning by doing\u201d is the central axis along which we seek to bolster the fellows\u2019 potential for influence. The \u201clearning by doing\u201d approach aims to refine and intensify the fellows\u2019 sense of responsibility and mission, and empowers them to lead and work for the benefit of society in the North and beyond. The combination of knowledge acquisition and practical experience helps the fellows put their learning into practice, incorporate it into their workaday lives, expand their sphere of influence, become more familiar with the diverse society in the North, and deepen their ability to take action for the benefit of society. The fulcrum of this learning axis is in-depth study of the North and its challenges.\nThe field exercise is spread evenly over the year. Often, it is conducted in small \u201ctask teams\u201d that intentionally comprise fellows who are diverse professionally, ethnically, and culturally. The teams study designated issues in the North from various perspectives, with the aim of coming up with adequate ways to respond to the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities at hand.\nFollowing participation in a series of preliminary tours titled \u201cA Journey of Exploration of the North,\u201d the fellows set out to work in teams targeting four areas of central relevance to the life and wellbeing of the diverse members of society of the North: 1) public health, 2) general and higher education, 3) urban planning and housing, and 4) economic development and the labor market.\nIn the first week of December, the fellows completed their first segment of study, \u201cBarefoot Learning.\u201d This segment focused on mapping and investigating their designated field by gathering knowledge, raising questions, and analyzing relevant data. Subsequently, a \u201cpeak day\u201d was held, during which the fellows presented the results of their work and received feedback from a panel of experts in the various areas of study.\nDuring the last week of January, the fellows will begin the second segment of the field exercise, titled \"Local Stories.\" During this segment, the fellows will characterize and define their chosen topic as it pertains to a specific community or circumscribed location in the North. They will present their findings in mid-February.\nThe group field exercise will be followed by an individual exercise, in which the fellows are urged to focus on a social issue that is of profound interest to them and which they would like to study in depth. The fellows devise their own course of study, including conceptualization, theoretical issues, and relevant academic literature, clarification of positions, analysis of case studies, meetings with key figures, and surveys of relevant organizations. At the end of this process, the fellows will present their research, the areas that they have identified as targets for viable intervention and impact, and their plans for promoting the latter following their graduation from the program.\nThe axis of \u201clearning by doing\u201d includes support from mentors who are experts in the fields and areas of study selected by the fellows, as well as input from a team of experts who provide specific feedback and advice as needed.\n","html_content":"<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/North-Connection-5.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"Fellows sitting around a table and working on computers\">\n   <span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">A meeting of the employment and economic development group (Photo: Dana Kleinman)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><br>For the past two years, fellows of the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in the North and the Mandel Program for Leadership for Public Service in the North have been participating in \u201c<strong>The Northern Connection<\/strong>,\u201d a study module designed to foster their regional identity and sense of belonging to Israel\u2019s North.

These include Juha's Guesthouse\u00a0\u2013 a joint project of Ahmad and Haifa Jurban and their partner Neta Henien \u2013 and Beachub, an eco-friendly beachfront co-working resort.\nSAWA is a new initiative established in Jisr a-Zarqa by two graduates of Cohort 4 of the Mandel Program for Local Leadership in the North: Celia Jubari, who lives in the Arab town of Kafr Qara, and Michal Sadeh-Goldvasser, who lives in Zichron Yaacov. A social worker and social entrepreneur, Michal is the director of impact at the Mifras Educational Entrepreneurship Incubator and is involved in vocational training for women in Jisr a-Zarqa, while Celia is an educational consultant and the director of Ma'an \u2013 The Unit for Students from Arab Society at Shenkar College of Engineering, Design, and Art. Their project is an outgrowth of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North\u2019s focus on training leaders for the diverse society of Israel\u2019s northern region and is an example of the involvement of graduates in activities that strengthen and advance emerging social processes.\n\nThe fellows chosen to participate in the three leadership programs of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North each year are social activists and people who hold senior positions in the public sector, local government, and non-profit organizations, who live or work in northern Israel. The Center takes steps to ensure that each group of participants faithfully reflects the diverse composition of the population of the north. The Center believes that leadership develops and is tested by active involvement in challenges in the field; as such, it sees its graduates and their activities as part of the efforts for social change in the North \u2013 an area of activity that is constantly being developed.\n\nCelia and Michal recognized the motivation and internal strength of the residents of Jisr az-Zarqa that have enabled the establishment of local initiatives that strengthen the community and encourage its leadership. Together with the women of the town, the two Mandel graduates established a design workshop to create fabric laptop sleeves. To this end, they enlisted Shenkar College \u2013 one of Israel\u2019s leading colleges for art and design. In addition to teaching women a craft and involving them in creative work, the workshop collaborates with other tourism projects in the town, and the laptop sleeves are sold as accessories at the Beachub co-working resort.\n\n\nCelia believes that exposing people to design through various tools, such as creating inspiration boards and bringing internal ideas into the workspace, contributes to the development of creative and practical thinking. Michal chooses to relate to the project through the emotional dimension, which is prominent in the meetings of the workshop. As she sees it, it is very important to establish a permanent building where women will be able to meet each other in a context that is equal, shared, and empowering. Michal and Celia share a vision to establish a permanent facility \u2013 both physical and human \u2013 that will offer a wide range of options and allow each woman to take from it what she can and as much as she wants, knowing that the Center is available to her at all times.\n\n\nIn a field of activity that has many players, ventures such as SAWA open and close all over Israel without making a significant impact. \"In this respect,\" says Celia, \"the Mandel program has made me very focused. Usually, I work laterally, instead of focusing on one thing from beginning to end, as Daphi Biran Singer [director of the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in the North] always says.\" Celia and Michal both have experience in social entrepreneurship, but they say that the Mandel program gave them confidence and a sense of capability. Without the emergence of internal forces from the field, however, it would have been impossible for them to act. In this regard, graduates of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North are part of an overall process of impact that enables them to apply leadership practices in order to be part of internal processes that have arisen in the field and to promote them.\nIn addition, the meeting between the two graduates and the close connection between the fellows of their cohort and all the graduates of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North have served to promote processes in the field. \"This is what enables us to move things in reality,\u201d they say. \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to the varied people who attend the Center\u2019s programs.\u201d\nToday, Michal and Celia are creating collaborations with other partners, primarily in the academic world, and are looking for a permanent facility in which to house and expand the activities of the SAWA workshop.\n","html_content":"<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/SAWA-3.jpg\" alt=\"Women meeting in the workshop (Photo courtesy of Michal Sadeh-Goldvasser and Celia Jubari)\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n   <span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Photo courtesy of Michal Sadeh-Goldvasser and Celia Jubari<br><\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>The Arab town of Jisr az-Zarqa in northern Israel, located on the Mediterranean coast between Caesarea and Zichron Yaacov, has a low socio-economic standing and has long suffered from a lack of opportunities for development.

As he explained, one of the main changes in this context is related to the place of women in Arab society; the role of women in society is becoming more dominant than in the past as more and more women receive an academic education and enter positions of influence.\nAlongside positive and optimistic developments, Professor Abu-Asbeh also noted the emergence of various crises in family life and in the family unit in the Arab sector: Arabic public education is being eroded, while private education is flourishing; government policies regarding education in the Arab sector are being set without consultation with Arab society; and young adults who work in hi-tech are leaving their villages and towns and are not investing in life there. The possible solutions suggested for these challenges included strengthening civic society so that it is better able to work within and on behalf of Arab society; changing the organizational culture in local government; and increasing government involvement.\nNext, the fellows met with Uri Kandel, executive director of Shared Paths, a joint Jewish-Arab nonprofit that operates locally-guided tours of Arab towns throughout Israel in order to introduce people to Arab society. Through these tours, the organization aims to educate visitors about the history of Arab society and the challenges it faces today, as well as to enable them to appreciate the rich cultural diversity of Arab society.\nAt the Umm al-Fahm municipality, the fellows met with Mayor Dr. Samir Mahamid, who left his career in education to enter politics. Dr. Mahamid presented the difficulties he faces as mayor, which include the need to combat violence, transportation problems, improving education, improving the city\u2019s public image, and more, both on a national level (e.g., government bureaucracy and budgets) and on a local level. He also noted the traditional power of the hamula in Arab society as a barrier to change.\nIn closing, the participants discussed their experiences over the course of the day. They focused on the gap between the city\u2019s image and what is actually happening on the ground; their lack of familiarity with different societies; the impact of the human tendency toward generalization; the fear of the unknown; and the fact that we are all heavily influenced by the media, which chooses to present only the extremes.\n","html_content":"<p><br>Fellows of the first cohort of the Mandel Program for Leadership in the Public Service participated in a field trip designed to enhance their familiarity with Arab society, which introduced them to sociologist <strong>Professor Khaled Abu-Asbeh<\/strong>, nonprofit director <strong>Uri Kandel<\/strong>, and <strong>Samir Mahamid<\/strong>, the mayor of Umm al-Fahm.<\/p>\n<p>At the start of the study tour, the fellows and faculty of the program visited the Umm al-Fahm Art Gallery.

This was a year of intensive study through many methods and various perspectives.\nThe program worked toward four goals this year:\nThe first goal was to create relationships and partnerships between the various groups of residents in Afula, by means of fruitful dialogue and building a common language among the fellows to influence the nature of public discourse in the city. The goal was for the discourse to focus on common interests of the residents while acknowledging their different visions for Afula's future and for improving the quality of life in the city. We worked toward this goal in two principal ways:\nOur second goal was to improve the fellows' working methods and their ability to influence their environment. The program emphasized examination of the work methods of the fellows. The fellows investigated their work methods in practice by clarifying their values, defining their vision, and engaging in theoretical conceptualization of their work in reality. For this purpose, the entire team was mobilized to develop a model of \"work analysis,\" under the guidance of Yafa Benaya, an outside consultant. A series of 12 meetings took place in four small groups, which were facilitated by four staff members who guided the fellows in investigating their activity in their workplaces. The fellows valued this part of the program very much. Each fellow received an opportunity to present key dilemmas in his or her professional and public environment and analyze them together with the facilitator and the group from a theoretical perspective, in an intimate, respectful atmosphere.\nThe third goal selected, based on preparatory research done for us by Dr. Meirav Aharon Gutman of the Technion, concerned the environment, at a time when Afula is undergoing an accelerated process of construction and physical growth. We studied and examined the options for optimal development of the rapidly changing urban space. According to Afula's master plan, the city's population is expected to reach approximately 130,000 residents by 2025. Together, using various tools, we investigated the range of options for developing a \"suitable city\" in terms of its physical, human, and communal make up. We devoted a series of meetings to in-depth study of the city: its history, processes of development, absorption of waves of immigration and the effect of the immigrants on the city, the meaning of its moniker \"the capital of the Jezreel Valley\" and its challenges. We discussed the values that define the suitable city, as well as various urban models for \"good urbanism,\" with their benefits and drawbacks. We learned about attempts by Israel and other countries to rebrand their cities, revive downtown areas, promote varied uses of the city, and engage in social urban planning that takes into account the variety of traffic in the public space as well as the needs of the various communities and groups that live there.\nThe fourth and final goal, which will accompany us into the second academic year of the program, is the city's relationship with its environment and the potential of regional development and cooperation between Afula and its neighbors.\n","html_content":"<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\u200bThe first year of the Mandel Program for Local Leadership in Afula is coming to an end, as the fellows submit their final projects and meet individually with the program directors.

She was followed by Dr. Ayman Agbaria, director \nof the Mandel Scholars in Education program in Jerusalem for outstanding\n doctoral students, who spoke about \u201cPolicy, Values, and Meaningful \nLearning,\u201d introducing participants to texts by the medieval Islamic \nscholars al-Farabi and al-Ghazali. Many participants noted that this \nexposure to an unfamiliar philosophy was very meaningful for them. \nFollowing the lecture, workshops led by Adi Nir Sagi, Dr. Smadar Ben \nAsher and Dr. Nitza Raskin from the Mandel Center for Leadership in the\n Negev, and Ayelet Ilany and Dalit Caspin from the center in the \nNorth, explored the ultimate objective of learning and the educational \nprocess in the school setting. The day concluded with a poetry-writing \nworkshop.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><br>The remaining two seminars in the series will take \nplace on March 20 and May 22. The program in March will deal primarily \nwith learning in the urban space. For this purpose, Akko\u2019s Old City will\n be transformed into a giant classroom, which the supervisors will \ncrisscross in small teams. The day is being planned in conjunction with \nEven Derech, a company specializing in experiential learning.<\/p>\n","images":[],"attachments":[],"outer_links":[]}}}
