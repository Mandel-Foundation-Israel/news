They face serious challenges in their work and activities, and are driven by a true sense of mission and historical purpose. Ten of them are educators and school principals. The rest operate in the social domain, working in fields such as community integration of people with mental illness, treatment of children at risk, teacher training, educational counseling, social work, and more. Since these professional fields are the fellows\u2019 main sphere of influence, these are the\u00a0areas in which they seek to bring about change.\nThe challenges faced in the Bedouin communities of the Negev are many and difficult. It is clear to the fellows that the problems are interlinked, such that it is very difficult to effect change in a given area if the other areas remain unchanged. This raises the question: What is the starting point for change? In other words: What is the Archimedean point that is not dependent on multiple factors over which the fellows have no control, where it is possible for fellows to bring about change that will have an impact on other areas of life? This desire for change is expressed in the informal name used by the Center\u2019s staff to refer to the program: the \u201cNAKSH\u201d program, which is an acronym of Neve Midbar, Al-Kasum, and Segev Shalom and an Arabic word meaning \u201cto leave one\u2019s mark.\u201d\nIn searching for the right paths toward change, it is important to bear in mind that this is the poorest population in Israel. This group numbers hundreds of thousands of people, the vast majority of whom are children, and is slowly adjusting to the enormous spatial, cultural, political, and technological developments of recent decades. As we know, even a journey of a thousand miles begins with one small step. The first step of the fellows is to look at what pains them personally. They can then translate that pain into a definition of a problem that they will address on their long journey ahead.\nTo build a map for navigating the complex realities of Bedouin life in the Negev, it is necessary to outline a picture of the future to which we aspire \u2013 to formulate a vision that is as ambitious and far-reaching as possible, yet not too utopian or removed from reality. A sober look at reality and ourselves does not mean sanctifying the current situation nor does it mean resigning ourselves to its limitations. On the contrary: The first stage of the program is dedicated to developing the fellows\u2019 ability to draw inspiration from others and translate that inspiration into their own language and circumstances. This is how the fellows identify the goals they seek to achieve. Values such as justice and courage are what enable the fellows to define their goals and affirm their determination to reach them.\nSometimes different fellows will approach the same problem and come up with different change strategies. Hassan Algnami, principal of the Al-Majid elementary school in Abu Karinat, is concerned about the fact that many students in the Bedouin community drop out of high school, whether overtly or covertly. He attributes the high dropout rates to a lack of empathy in secondary schools; only an empathetic environment, he believes, can be sensitive to the harsh life circumstances of many students while encouraging them to stay in the education system, when the students themselves often see staying in school as pointless. In order to better the future, Hassan envisions the establishment of educational frameworks that provide a continuum of education from kindergarten through 12th grade. These schools will emphasize human warmth and not just academic success, and thus will be able to counter a root cause of dropout. Such frameworks do not exist in Bedouin Arab society in the Negev, although they are not rare in Jewish society.\nAnother fellow, Salem Tohi, who is the principal of the Bir Asluj school in Bir Hadaj, is troubled by the very same problem. He, however, attributes dropout to a lack of a clear picture of the future and a lack of any knowledge whatsoever about higher education on the part of the students. Thus, his change initiative is centered around exposing students to higher education even before they reach high school, so as to pique their curiosity and interest them in continuing their studies over time.\nThe fellows of the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in Al-Kasum, Neve Midbar and Segev Shalom are the standard-bearers for the Bedouin Arab community in the Negev. These men and women are bright, knowledgeable, open to change, and committed to making a difference. We have no doubt that they will.\n","html_content":"<p>\n   <img src=\"\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/MCLN-bedouin-2022.jpg\" alt=\"Program fellows at a retreat at Yad Hashmona (Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel)\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n<span class=\"ms-rteStyle-References\">Program fellows at a retreat at Yad Hashmona (Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel)<\/span>\n<\/p>\n<p>The three Bedouin local authorities of Al-Kasum, Neve Midbar, and Segev Shalom contain a total of 35 unrecognized villages, including some that are not connected to Israel\u2019s electricity and water networks and that lack decent access roads.

The study of visual culture focuses both on visible space, and on the mechanisms that play a role in its construction. The underlying premise of the field is that the act of viewing is never neutral; rather, it is mediated by bodies of knowledge, power struggles, desires, and ideologies that seek to imbue the visual with different and changing meanings.\nThe retreat began at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where the fellows learned about how the Institute presents the relation between science and scientific institutions and the visual. As they walked through the campus, the fellows noted its landscaping and environmental sculptures, the typography on its buildings, and the spatial design of the laboratories. An architectural tour, which began with the historic home of Vera and Chaim Weizmann, showcased the international style of Erich Mendelsohn, several buildings in the brutalist style, and glass buildings of the 21st-century. A conversation with Yivsam Azgad, the Institute\u2019s art curator, revealed a fascinating policy that brings together science and art, as well as scientists and artists.\nFrom Rehovot, the fellows continued to Tel Aviv, where they explored a series of visual statements that embody different relations between components of identity and social and political questions. They began at an exhibition attempting to expand the boundaries of the concept of \u201cclimate change\u201d so that it can serve as a metaphorical tool for examining questions relating to the climate of gender. A conversation with the exhibition curator, Erez Bialer, explored representations of the male body in contemporary art. In the evening, on the roof of the gallery, the fellows met with performer and fashion designer Kay Long and discussed the relations between fashion, identity, periphery, and center.\nOn the second morning, the group visited the studio of Gary Goldstein, an artist whose visual grammar is taken from old movie posters, billboards, and movements such as pop art, surrealism, and Dadaism. Goldstein, who was born in the South of the United States and was raised in Connecticut by his Holocaust-survivor parents, described his work as a constant attempt to process the demons and shadows that stem from the horrors of his family\u2019s past.\nFrom the intimate and the personal, the fellows moved on to observing visual statements in public spaces. They took a tour with photographer Vered Navon, who led a struggle to save 40 ficus trees on Jerusalem Boulevard in Jaffa, based on research of old photographs of the street. The fellows\u2019 interaction with the boulevard, its passersby, and the architectural geology surrounding the boulevard, provided important insights into the links between visual displays and national myths, romantic yearnings, and economic interests.\n\nThe retreat concluded with a visit to the Design Terminal in Bat Yam, a social design compound in a renovated warehouse that includes a rehabilitation facility, a common yard, and an incubator for designers which collaborates with the rehabilitation initiatives. Liron Hershkovitz, CEO and co-founder of Out of the Box, the nonprofit behind the Terminal, spoke with the group about design as a tool for economic, social, and cultural change. At the MOLET studio in the compound, the fellows learned about upcycling \u2013 the process of recycling and upgrading products and materials \u2013 and tried their hand at transforming wooden pallets into benches, planters, and toys.\nDuring the study unit on visual culture, the group examined the ways in which different scopic regimes affirm what is obvious and widely accepted.

Their projects included art by Bedouin women, a spoken-word performance about the realities of the pandemic, photography examining social issues in the Negev, graphic design exhibits focusing on figures who symbolize Negev localness, and more.

The conversation opened with several dilemmas raised by the coverage of Operation Guardian of the Walls, Israel\u2019s recent military operation against Hamas in Gaza, and with a discussion of the difficulties raised by current affairs coverage in general. Among other questions, the two journalists were asked about some of the ethical challenges raised by media coverage: How do correspondents react to competing and contradictory demands, such as the network directing them to enter a house that has sustained a direct rocket attack, while their own conscience tells them not to violate the family\u2019s privacy in such a manner?

This, the participants concluded, is simply one of the responsibilities of cultural leaders.<\/p>\n","images":{"negev-06-21-2.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/negev.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/negev-06-21-2.jpg","caption":""},"negev-06-21.jpg":{"src":"https:\/\/negev.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/negev-06-21.jpg","caption":""}},"attachments":[],"outer_links":[]},"negev-reinharz-2021":{"title":"Gaza Border Fellows Meet with Professor Jehuda Reinharz","date":"2021-05-27","image":"https:\/\/negev.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/Negev-JR-6-21-2_s.jpg","excerpt":"The meeting with the Mandel Foundation president focused on leadership challenges during times of emergency\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/negev.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Negev-Reinharz-2021.aspx","is_inner":"yes","slug":"negev-reinharz-2021","text":"\u200bDuring Professor Jehuda Reinharz\u2019s visit to Israel in May, , the fellows of the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in the Gaza Border Communities were treated to a fascinating meeting with him on the\u00a0 leadership challenges that face the communities of the region, especially during times of emergency.\nThe meeting with the president of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Foundation was preceded by two extremely difficult weeks of rocket attacks in the region, an experience that had deeply affected each of the program\u2019s fellows in different ways.

The graduation ceremony, which took place in the Malachim Forest with total adherence to the Ministry of Health's \u201cPurple Seal\u201d regulations, was moving, meaningful, and full of hope. A booklet of position papers \u2013 the result of the practical component of the program \u2013 was presented during the ceremony. This booklet will serve as a basis for the graduates\u2019 ongoing work in the Negev.\nLed by Kassim Alsraiha and Dr. Rotem Bresler-Gonen, the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in Kseifa and Arara BaNegev was comprised of 14 fellows who live or work in the region of Kseifa and Arara BaNegev, and hold key positions in these localities. The fellows all have a deep familiarity with the region and a strong desire to influence and effect change.\n\nThe practical component of the program, which was one of the major parts of the training, provided the fellows with a framework for expressing and practicing their leadership skills. At the program's concluding ceremony, the fellows presented a booklet of position papers entitled \u201cA Voice from the Field,\u201d which contained the product of the practical component. The booklet is the theoretical and practical result of the group projects that were developed as part of the program. These projects focused on three areas \u2013 education, health, and youth in Arab-Bedouin society in the Negev \u2013 as follows:\nThe education group focused on \"The Involvement of Parents in Schools.\" Their exploration reflected the belief that parental involvement has a far-reaching impact on student achievement and on the climate of schools; therefore, increasing parental involvement can bring about profound change not only for students, but also for the school, the parents, and the entire community.\nThe health group studied health disparities between Jews and Arabs in general and between the general population of Israel and Bedouin society in particular. The group focused upon morbidity rates of diseases that are common in Arab-Bedouin society in the Negev, which affect quality of life and life expectancy. The fellows also investigated the connection between these diseases and the unique lifestyle, culture, and rural way of life of Negev Bedouin society.\nThe youth group dealt with the needs of young Negev Bedouin in the reality of a changing society. Young people aged 18 to 25 often fall between the cracks in Bedouin society in Israel. Unlike young Jewish Israelis, Bedouin youth do not enlist in the army, and have neither the time nor place to continue to \u201cmature\u201d as young adults and expand their vision of their future as civilians. The participants in this focus group envision integrating young members of the Bedouin community into educational and employment frameworks by creating a support mechanism that will guide them in their adult lives. This group also noted the differences between young men and young women in Bedouin society, and referred to both groups in its position paper.\nThe three position papers in the booklet reflect the significant learning process that the fellows underwent, and serve as an opportunity for courageous and responsible leaders to make their voices heard, in professional language, by decision-makers and policy-makers. These papers, which address topics that are pertinent and significant for coping with the unique challenges of Arab-Bedouin society in the Negev, proved more relevant than ever during the period of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nKassim Alsraiha, the director of the program, said in his address to the graduates: \u201cAnyone who reads the position papers that you prepared after a long process of deliberation, discussion, debate, and even deep value-based disagreements, will be amazed at the quality and importance of the result that was achieved despite the coronavirus pandemic. The product of your studies cannot be taken for granted. Your awareness of the importance of the group projects, and the fact that you forfeited your individual practical projects due to your understanding that the challenges that you addressed were identical \u2013 is proof of your leadership, as you put the interests of the group before your personal interests. As the historian Ibn Khaldun put it, \u2018Leadership comes only as the result of maturation, and maturation takes place only due to the collective consciousness.\u2019\u201d\nKassim said that the group position papers developed by the fellows were an outgrowth of the concrete work of the individual fellows, which then branched out to broader, more important, and more essential fields of activity. The program\u2019s staff see the position papers as the successful culmination of a journey of learning, and are proud of the courageous thinking of the fellows and of the way that they addressed important topics that reflect real need. They are also proud that the fellows not only described the problems of Arab-Bedouin society in the Negev, but also formulated positions and proposed actual solutions.\nMoshe Vigdor, the director general of Mandel Foundation\u2013Israel, addressed the graduates remotely by video. In his inspiring remarks, he spoke of the group\u2019s belonging to the broad Mandel community, reiterated the late Morton Mandel\u2019s vision of working toward an accepting, inclusive, and pluralistic society in the State of Israel, and expressed his great appreciation alongside the hopes that we have regarding our graduates. \u201cMort Mandel, of blessed memory, created the Mandel Foundation in Israel in 1962 to attract people with the ability, vision, drive, and passion to change and better Israeli society,\" he said. \"Each and every one of you can make changes for the better, each in his or her field \u2013 but together this has a cumulative effect that improves life in Israel. We miss Mort Mandel very much these days \u2013 his insight, wisdom, initiative, and optimistic vision. He would always tell the graduates who came to thank him: \u2018Don\u2019t thank me; I need to thank you because you are doing my work. You will go out into the field and make Israeli society better.\u2019 So on the one hand, we expect quite a lot of you, but in Mort's spirit, we would also like to thank you for the good work that we know you will do.\u201d\n\nDr. Adi Nir-Sagi, the director of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev, congratulated the graduates as well. \u201cYour journey of learning has ended. It was a process of in-depth study, analytic thinking, and critical discussion about the challenges of leadership in the Negev. This process required a commitment from each of you, as both a vision and a value: a commitment to improving the quality of life of Arab-Bedouin society in the Negev. The continuation of this process will be seen in your work as graduates of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev in the near future, which will be characterized by commitment and courage.\u201d Adi referred to the fact that the fellows had chosen to conceptualize complex issues while looking into traditional values and searching for alternatives that create change. She also spoke of the sad loss this year of Mr. Mandel, founder of the Mandel Foundation, who saw each individual fellow as an illustration of his mantra \"It's all about who.\u201d As he said, \"Even one person can change the world. Powerful ideas, driven by outstanding people, represent a sure way to light more candles and illuminate the world.\u201d Adi emphasized her great faith in each of the graduates and the hope that they will continue to engage in work that will change the world, for the betterment of the community and society of the Negev.\nThe graduates expressed their gratitude to the Mandel Foundation and to the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev for giving them the opportunity to undergo this profound and significant process. They said that for them, the conclusion of the program was not the end of the road, but closed a cycle in which they came full circle, and marked the beginning of their journey of change and action in the Negev.\nRead the booklet of\u00a0position papers (Hebrew) >>\n","html_content":"<p>\u200bThe Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in Kseifa and Arara BaNegev, a two-year program of in-depth study that began in October 2018, marked its conclusion on July 15, 2020.

Despite the evident conclusion that there is a need to plot a new course, one insight is becoming increasingly clear as we delve deeper into the situation. COVID-19 has made what we already know much clearer: there is a global trend in which Western culture has taken center stage in all regions, including the margins and peripheries of the globe.\nParadoxically, it seems that the current \u201cCOVID-19 -Zoom\u201d times \u2013 which blur distinctions between near and far, and in which geographical location has ostensibly lost its significance \u2013 offer an opportunity to explore interesting alternatives to cultural hegemony and to examine the question of how to infuse the concept of \u201clocalness\u201d with meaning.\nThe program's initial study days during this period, accordingly, were an accelerated exploration of a basic question facing artists the world over: How does the impulse to act in our immediate environment and to create content with immediate relevance to the global crisis fit in with the need to recalibrate and reshape cultural discourse during times of crisis?\nThe first two virtual study days during the shut-down were led by Hadas Kedar, a new faculty member at the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev, who is running the Mandel Program for Cultural Leadership in the Negev together with Professor Dana Arieli and Dr. Itzhak (Kiki) Aharonovich.\nIn the background of the remote learning period is a lecture by Dr. Aharonovich lecture on planning, mapping, and space that raised questions about cultural activity as it relates to policy planning in Israel.\nIn the first online session, Hadas dealt with local culture and the extent to which works of art relate to their environment, through three examples of local ecological art projects that make a clear statement about sustainability and protection of nature. These included Itzhak Danziger's Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry (1971) and Bustan Khayat (The Khayat Orchard) (1977), both of which are located in nature and relate to the history of the location. The third work discussed was Avital Geva\u2019s Ecological Greenhouse (1977) at Kibbutz Ein Shemer, which was designed around the concept of an autarkic market found in nature and later represented Israel at the Venice Biennale in 1993. The fellows discussed the environmental contexts that Geva and Danziger\u2019s projects highlighted via local artistic means.\nIn the same session, the fellows also engaged in a close examination of Project Wadi Attir as an example of a contemporary ecological project in the Negev that highlights similar aspects of the historical ecological projects presented. The Wadi Attir project, which was initiated by Dr. Muhammad Al-Nabari, ex-mayor of Hura, and architect Dr. Michael Ben-Eli, is dedicated to the collection, preservation, reconstruction, and teaching of traditional culture and ancient agricultural technologies.\nThe fellows then virtually met with Dr. Ofri Ilany and spoke with him about his article \u201cThe Role of the Intellectual in the Age of Extinction,\u201d which they had read in preparation for the session. Together, they discussed the role of artists and intellectuals in light of ecological dangers (which are especially pronounced in desert regions), and explored the relationship between the coronavirus crisis and the climate crisis. Dr. Ilany raised a question concerning the difficulty encountered when trying to influence public opinion and achieve changes in lifestyles (such as cutting down on flying and driving and limiting consumption) when it comes to the climate crisis, as compared to what has taken place in response to COVID-19. The discussion concluded with the hope that the current pandemic will teach humanity that it is possible to take precautions in order to protect the delicate balance between humans and nature.\nThe COVID-19 period has made it even clearer to us that as cultural entrepreneurs in the Negev, we must continue to act and to create worthy alternatives to global culture, and that these alternatives are to be found within the \"local-singular\" characteristics of the Negev: diverse populations; creative discourse; the land; and concern for ecological balance in the natural environment \u2013 these all provide creative individuals in the Negev with material to be expressed via artistic means.\n","html_content":"<p>The COVID-19 crisis began as the fellows of the second cohort of the Mandel Program for Cultural Leadership in the Negev were in the midst of a process of investigating the links between society and place in the context of culture in the Negev.<\/p>\n<p>As the crisis continues, with its immense uncertainty and the program's remote learning practice continuing, it is growing increasingly clear that we are in the middle of a global experiment and any attempt to properly understand these times requires perspective and processing.<\/p>\n<p>The initial exhilaration from being able to \u201cjump\u201d from a concert in New York to a theater production in London with just a click of a mouse, has confused our understanding of \u201cnear\u201d and \u201cfar.\u201d This excitement eventually gave way to fatigue stemming from a massive amount of content available and the lack of time available to consume it.

These attacks and nearly constant tension threaten daily routine, span every aspect of life, and necessitate living in a constant state of alert. The region\u2019s residents contend with unimaginable challenges of life under fire alongside a real commitment to life in the region, setting a profound example of modern Zionist commitment. In such a reality, it is vital to develop local leadership that knows how to provide civil and social responses that build community resilience.\nThe Gaza border region is socially diverse, encompassing both urban and rural settlement of varying socioeconomic status, which are made up of veteran Israelis and new immigrants of different ethnic origins, and religious and secular populations. Despite the difficult reality, in recent years the region has in fact experienced demographic growth and development in the fields of education, employment, community and tourism. Nonetheless, studies on the impact of growing up in Gaza border communities confirm that civilians exhibit PTSD-related symptoms and behaviors. Sderot, the city closest to the border has many NGOs dedicated to helping people of all ages cope with these challenges. These organizations focus mainly on therapeutic intervention.\nOverall residents of the Gaza border communities do manage to cope, although the difficult conditions create unique challenges for economic and community life. A recent example is the Darom Adom (Red South) Festival, an annual event that spans several weekends in January\u2013March, when the red anemones blossom in the western Negev. The festival provides an organized response to the needs of the many visitors seeking to enjoy the blossoming flowers, as well as to the needs of the service providers and private businesses in the area. The latest round of rocket attacks affected the entrepreneurs and communities of the Gaza border region just as they were preparing for and relying on the influx of tourists during the festival as leverage for economic development.\nIn response to these needs, in October 2020, the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev will launch the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in the Gaza Border Communities for participants from the western Negev. Led by program director Dr. Rotem Bresler-Gonen and faculty member Dr. Gili Zivan, the program aims to build a cadre of leadership for the Gaza border area from among diverse communities, all of whom strive to lead safe and secure lives.\u00a0The program will be based on the Center's educational model, which involves joint study of local leaders in a given region. This creates a sense of partnership that crosses municipal boundaries and provides the grounds for cooperative acts of leadership in the future that will benefit all residents of the region.\nThe specific geographic area for the program participants includes the city of Sderot and the regional councils of Sdot Negev, Eshkol, Hof Ashkelon and Sha\u2019ar HaNegev.

These attacks and nearly constant tension threaten daily routine, span every aspect of life, and necessitate living in a constant state of alert. The region\u2019s residents contend with unimaginable challenges of life under fire alongside a real commitment to life in the region, setting a profound example of modern Zionist commitment. In such a reality, it is vital to develop local leadership that knows how to provide civil and social responses that build community resilience.<\/p>\n<p>The Gaza border region is socially diverse, encompassing both urban and rural settlement of varying socioeconomic status, which are made up of veteran Israelis and new immigrants of different ethnic origins, and religious and secular populations. Despite the difficult reality, in recent years the region has in fact experienced demographic growth and development in the fields of education, employment, community and tourism. Nonetheless, studies on the impact of growing up in Gaza border communities confirm that civilians exhibit PTSD-related symptoms and behaviors. Sderot, the city closest to the border has many NGOs dedicated to helping people of all ages cope with these challenges. These organizations focus mainly on therapeutic intervention.<\/p>\n<p>Overall residents of the Gaza border communities do manage to cope, although the difficult conditions create unique challenges for economic and community life. A recent example is the Darom Adom (Red South) Festival, an annual event that spans several weekends in January\u2013March, when the red anemones blossom in the western Negev. The festival provides an organized response to the needs of the many visitors seeking to enjoy the blossoming flowers, as well as to the needs of the service providers and private businesses in the area. The latest round of rocket attacks affected the entrepreneurs and communities of the Gaza border region just as they were preparing for and relying on the influx of tourists during the festival as leverage for economic development.<br><\/p>\n<p>In response to these needs, in October 2020, the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev will launch the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in the Gaza Border Communities for participants from the western Negev. Led by program director \n   <strong>Dr. Rotem Bresler-Gonen<\/strong> and faculty member \n   <strong>Dr. Gili Zivan<\/strong>, the program aims to build a cadre of leadership for the Gaza border area from among diverse communities, all of whom strive to lead safe and secure lives.&nbsp;The program will be based on the Center's educational model, which involves joint study of local leaders in a given region. This creates a sense of partnership that crosses municipal boundaries and provides the grounds for cooperative acts of leadership in the future that will benefit all residents of the region.<\/p>\n<p>The specific geographic area for the program participants includes the city of Sderot and the regional councils of Sdot Negev, Eshkol, Hof Ashkelon and Sha\u2019ar HaNegev. The five regional authorities selected consist mainly of rural communities \u2013 kibbutzim and moshavim \u2013 and were selected based on a systematic locality study conducted towards developing the program as well as a study conducted in dialogue with the heads of these authorities, who all acknowledge the importance of conducting this leadership program.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As part of its preparations for the program, the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev met with key figures in the Gaza border region in order to recruit a large group of talented candidates.

The unique study day aimed to foster connections between the fellows of all the programs currently underway at the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev; to create opportunities for shared dialogue on questions of leadership in the Negev; and to explore theoretical and practical aspects of visions, areas of interest, and initiatives. In targeting these goals, the study day was designed to create the infrastructure for a community of Mandel fellows working together to lead change throughout the Negev.\n\nThe location chosen for the event was the Idan HaNegev industrial park in Rahat. The park is the product of collaboration between three local authorities: the city of Rahat, the Bnei Shimon regional council, and the Lehavim local council. The industrial park serves as an important driver of growth, employment, and economic development for the region, while it embodies the values of mutual respect, excellence, and community engagement. Some 2,600 employees, both Jews and Arabs, work in this industrial park, which is becoming an important center of employment that is changing the face of the northern Negev.\n\nThe day began with a workshop designed to introduce the fellows of the three different programs to one another. The fellows then met with Moshe Paul, the CEO of Idan HaNegev, who presented the vision behind the establishment of the park, and explained how this vision was realized. Next, the mayor of Rahat, Faiz Abu Sahiban, described the partnerships forged by the heads of the three local authorities in order to establish the park. Following his presentation, Sigal Moran, who headed the Bnei Shimon regional council and was involved in the development of Idan HaNegev from the very start, spoke about the long and complicated process of reaching agreements and creating alliances that led to the park\u2019s establishment.\nDuring their tour of the park, the fellows were divided into four study groups, each of which combined fellows from different programs. The first group focused on local authorities from a regional perspective. This group met with Nir Zamir, head of the Bnei Shimon regional council, who spoke about the impressive demographic growth in council\u2019s communities, and explained how the success of Idan HaNegev was leveraged to develop additional industrial centers as regional initiatives.\n\nThe second group focused on governance. This group met with Sigal Moran, former head of the Bnei Shimon regional council, and with Lilach Columbus, a graduate of Cohort 2 of the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in Beer Sheva, who had served as Moran\u2019s personal assistant. The discussion explored questions of governance and leadership based on partnerships for regional development.\nThe third group examined the issue of employment. This group heard from six guest speakers who spoke about the employment of Bedouin women in the Negev, with a particular focus on cottage industries initiated by women entrepreneurs in the community. Two main issues emerged from the discussions that ensued: First, the larger problem of employment in the Negev, for both men and women in all groups and sectors, with an emphasis on the question of why Negev residents are left without work while jobs in places such as Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and the Beer Sheva hi-tech park are filled by people from other parts of the country. Second, there was criticism of home-based initiatives for women as a solution for unemployment in Bedouin society, based on claims that this approach reproduces the existing power structures in the community, and frames Bedouin culture as no more than folklore.\n\nThe fourth group explored initiatives in education. This group met with Adi Zand, CEO of Edulog, who spoke about her efforts to advance innovative ideas in education via a private company that works with the Ministry of Education to provide consulting and mentoring to schools.\nThe day concluded with a panel in which representatives of each of the three participating programs reviewed the learning process, and with a presentation of the personal visions of all the fellows, which was designed to promote shared discourse and joint action.\nThe stormy weather that characterized the day, and the sandstorm that blanketed the area with yellow dust, served as a reminder of the nature of the area in which the fellows are fully committed to working.

The retreat aimed to further the creation of a Mandel graduate community in the Negev. The experience of learning and sharing together fostered a fruitful dialogue that can serve as the basis for action and leadership processes that will be able to make changes in education, community, and culture in the Negev.\nNo fewer than 36 graduates participated, a record number for retreats of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev. The group included representatives from almost every previous program, with an all-time high of ten graduates from the first cohort of the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in Beer Sheva.\nThe first stop was the Museum on the Seam. Rafi Etgar, the founder and director of the museum, introduced the graduates to the site while giving a harsh critique of today\u2019s younger generation and their lack of tolerance and patience. The central exhibit at the museum was an exhibition of portraits of Jerusalemites; throughout the tour of the exhibit, graduates expressed the opinion that residents of the Negev are more tolerant than their peers in Israel's capital.\nThe second stop was the Feuerstein Institute. There they met with the director, Rabbi Rafi Feuerstein, who is the son of the Institute\u2019s founder and inventor of its method, Israel Prize laureate Reuven Feuerstein. Rabbi Feuerstein began by describing the Institute\u2019s staff as \u201creligious zealots\u201d when it comes to the Institute's method for integrating people with severe cognitive disabilities into normative educational and social settings. His description of the method\u2019s success was met with amazement, not only because it was backed up with objective data, but because the participants were also given the opportunity to observe a sample lesson taught by Avner Sorek, son of Israel Sorek, a faculty member of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev. The Institute\u2019s director of education, Yaara Yeshurun, assured the participants that the lesson was not a \u201cshow for guests,\u201d but rather a routine class.\nDuring the lesson, the participants were shown how by solely using images, it is possible to put forward an accurate and reasoned description of what they depict and the emotions they inspire, in a way that requires a more precise use of words. The students in the class (some of whom have Downs\u2019 syndrome, and others who have moderate-to-high levels of cognitive disability) displayed high ability to describe and to reason.\nAfter a break, the work began. A round of introductions was followed by a question: How is it possible to translate the desire to build a community of Mandel graduates and to bolster the effectiveness of graduates\u2019 acts of leadership into the language of practice, identity, and commitment? A number of moving encounters between graduates emerged in the circles of conversation that were randomly assigned.\nDuring the long Jerusalem night, the graduates got little rest. Inspiring and remarkable cultural initiatives were investigated in the faint moonlight, and the Jerusalem nightlife was found to be surprisingly vital. The graduates did not fall behind. Lively conversations were held over drinks, and their impact was felt in the next day\u2019s closing discussion.\n\nThe second day began and ended with a plenum session. Professor Dana Arieli and Israel Sorek spoke about real and imagined memories, while Maskit Hodsman (a graduate of Cohort 2 of the Mandel Program for Regional Leadership in Beer Sheva) and Dr. Itzhak (Kiki) Aharonovich presented a session on mind maps. This new concept was introduced and the participants tried it for the first time in mapping the retreat.\nThe discussion lasted for 30 minutes beyond the allotted time. The graduates were in no hurry to end this unusual retreat, which rekindled hopes for the Mandel Negev community and its capacity for action and initiative. The great heatwave was not over, but a fresh wind was blowing among the graduates of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev.\n\n","html_content":"<p>\u200bOn August 1, at the height of a summer heatwave, as Israeli families were counting down the days to the end of the school vacation and the Israeli economy was in the midst of its traditional summer slumber, graduates of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev embarked on a retreat in Jerusalem.

The geographic isolation and socioeconomic status of Mitzpe Ramon demand that the city takes steps to grow while facing many challenges. In recent years, young leaders have emerged who seek to create, rejuvenate, and have a positive influence on the community, as it absorbs young families, artists, and entrepreneurs who see it as a place of inspiration and growth.\nAt the start of the day, Dr. Adi Nir-Sagi, the director of the Center, quoted Professor Alexander Haslam, a researcher on leadership whose studies pay particularly attention to the group, in which an individual influences the other members of the group in order to accomplish goals that are based on a social vision. According to Professor Alexander, the social identity of \u201cwe\u201d is powerful and effects change. In the case of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev, the \u201cwe\u201d comprises the fellows of the various programs, who aspire to improve quality of life in the Negev by working together.\nThe session continued with a workshop facilitated by Professor Smadar Ben-Asher, which aimed to introduce the groups of fellows to one another by creating a shared frame story by combining individual life stories that each fellow chose to share with the group. Next, the fellows met with Roni Marom, Mayor of Mitzpe Ramon, who presented the work he has been doing in the community and the vision that forms the basis of his work over the next several years.

At the beginning of the event, faculty member Dr. Itzhak (Kiki) Aharonovich introduced Professor Wolfsohn and read aloud several of the poems in the book. One of the Arabic poems in the book was read by Salah Abu Jafar, a graduate of the first cohort of the Mandel Program for Local Leadership in Rahat.\u00a0\nThe poems proved fertile ground for a discussion of the ecological-environmental situation in Israel, with a particular focus on the Negev.

It also explored the level of public awareness (or lack thereof) regarding the power of ordinary citizens and Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection to act on these issues.\u00a0\nProfessor Wolfsohn highlighted the inherent power of culture, and its importance for the ecological struggle, stressing that what is needed is a shared culture of environmental issues that includes public discourse, active leadership, and efforts to change people\u2019s habits.

It is also a time in which each individual contemplates his or her ethical priorities.\" <\/p>\n<p>The meal provided an opportunity for the fellows and members of the steering committee members to become personally acquainted with one another and to think together about the leadership challenges of developing quality of life in the Negev.<\/p>\n","images":[],"attachments":[],"outer_links":[]},"haifa-retreat":{"title":"Haifa Retreat: Leadership as a Struggle","date":"2016-06-19","image":"https:\/\/negev.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/SiteCollectionImages\/News\/retreat-haifa-2016_Small.jpg","excerpt":"The last retreat of the Beer Sheva program focused on protest and struggles for social justice and environmental conservation, and enabled fellows to explore the role of local leaders in such struggles\u00a0","link":"https:\/\/negev.mandelfoundation.org.il\/english\/About\/News\/Pages\/Haifa-Retreat.aspx","is_inner":"yes","slug":"haifa-retreat","text":"\u200bIn a departure from convention, the last retreat of the third cohort of the Mandel Local Leadership Program in Beer Sheva was not devoted to summing up, to an interpersonal encounter, or to statements of reconciliation, hope, and consolation. Instead, it was dedicated to an analysis of protest and struggles for social justice and environmental conservation, and to the role of leaders in leading such struggles.\nThe retreat began in Kishon Park, in the heart of the Haifa Bay region, with the story of Dr. Smadar Ben Asher, the program director. Dr. Ben Asher spoke about the enormous moral and leadership challenge of speaking truth to government and big business, about the economy, and about forces that muzzle protest.\nThe fellows met with Yehuda Haber, a former navy diver, who dove in the Kishon River as part of his training and \u2013 like many of his fellow commandos \u2013 fell ill with cancer. They also met with Shmulik Gelbhart, an architect who spent many years as a member of the municipal establishment and is now a consultant for environmental groups in the Haifa Bay area. Haber spoke about his experiences as a naval commando in the days when commanders punished their subordinates by forcing them to drink water from the Kishon River, and when diving there was a regular occurrence. Gelbhart said that his case was not representative: in most cases, petrochemical plants co-opted environmental activists and turned them into advocates on their behalf.\nThe morbidity statistics in the Haifa Bay area are highly disturbing. The fact that it is impossible to point to a clear causative link between environmental pollution and the harm the population has suffered \u2013 the kind of link that will stand up to legal tests and force a policy change \u2013 does not sufficiently explain the degree of fatigue that local residents are displaying or the difficulty that environmental activists are having in leading local residents toward a much more intensive struggle.\nNext the group met with two men from different backgrounds who have formed a strong friendship: Munir Saloum, an Arab resident of Kiryat Eliyahu, which borders on Haifa's German Colony, and Yehezkel Varshay, a religiously-observant Jewish man who moved to the same neighborhood after having lived for many years in the Carmel region as a member of the established middle class. Saloum and Varshay did not try to present a model of Jewish-Arab cooperation, nor did they demonstrate a new model of peacemaking. Instead, they told the story of a simple and steadfast friendship between families living in a community motivated by brotherhood rather than common interests. While brotherhood is a resource with positive economic results, such results are not its goal, and it will continue to exist even without them.\nThe next activist to meet with the group was Yaron Hadar, whose highest priority is the Carmel region's Hadar neighborhood, which has more than 40,000 residents. A social entrepreneur and social activist, Hadar has led local struggles in favor of public parks and relief measures for small businesses, as well as encounters between Jews, Arabs, and new immigrants. He has been so successful in these efforts as a volunteer that he now does the same things as an employee of the municipal establishment. He stressed that the struggles have not disappeared, as one might have expected; rather, they have merely changed their shape.\nThe lecture of Rafi Kimchi, a faculty member of the Social Economic Academy in Haifa, took place at the end of the day. Kimchi spoke about workers' struggles in which he was involved, as well as those in which he was not involved. He said that workers never accomplished anything of significance without a fight. According to Kimchi, struggle is a necessary condition for improving the conditions of hired employees, and community leaders must take that into consideration as they build their identity and cause. Similarly, Kimchi believes that solidarity among workers is not necessarily an existential given, but is achieved through partnership in struggle.\nThe link between leadership and struggle, a prominent topic on this day of the retreat, seemed to run counter to the concept of the retreat itself. Even those who were troubled by the abundance of struggles admitted that a quick look at the injustices that continue to exist around us and in our society confirms the need for engaging in struggle as a necessary part of leadership development.\nWhat about those whose natural inclination is to pursue peace and compromise? During the course of the retreat, we learned that the term \"struggle\" has as many human meanings as the number of leaders who work for change and for promoting good in the world. It is possible to understand struggle through friendship, trust, cooperation, and seeking peace, as long as one does not lose one's way.\n","html_content":"<p>\u200bIn a departure from convention, the last retreat of the third cohort of the Mandel Local Leadership Program in Beer Sheva was not devoted to summing up, to an interpersonal encounter, or to statements of reconciliation, hope, and consolation.

With unsparing forthrightness, they asked Mitzna to describe not only his strengths but weaknesses as a leader. They confronted him with his accomplishments and failures, referred to success and criticism, and described his history in terms of the leadership that he displayed during different periods of his life: as an army commander, as the mayor of a large city (Haifa), as the head of a small local authority (Yeruham), and, for a period of time, as head of the Labor Party.\nWhen Mitzna was asked to name traits that characterized his leadership, he said: \"Trustworthiness, honesty, and integrity.\" He told an amusing anecdote about a live radio broadcast that took place during his term as mayor of Haifa, during which he told a listener that the municipality would not be solving a certain problem on his street anytime soon. He described how the listener and people close to him saw this honest and straightforward utterance as unacceptable for a public figure. \"There are so many ways to say no, to finesse things,\" they said. \"Did you have to tell him 'no' to his face?\"\nWhen the question arose as to how such a non-political man as Mitzna had succeeded in the political arena, Mitzna answered that he had not succeeded at all; the Labor Party lost the election under his leadership, and his personality as a national leader did not meet the test of results at the polls.\nDuring the meeting, Mitzna was asked other pointed questions about his move from the large city of Haifa to the small development town of Yeruham, about the fact that he had chosen to resign from the army, seemingly leaving the field to officers less ethical than he, and about his return to politics as part of the Kadima political party.\nOne unusual thing about Mitzna's answers was his constant acknowledgment that he might be wrong.

As part of this journey into our roots, we shared learning, insights and realizations, delved deeper, and returned to ourselves and our current individual reality.\nThe journey included four study sessions and a retreat for graduates. The first two meetings were facilitated by Dr. Muhammad Al Atawneh of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, a scholar of modern Islam and the development of Muslim law, and by Dr. Ruth Calderon, a former member of Knesset and a Talmud scholar. The third and fourth meetings were facilitated by Dr. Calderon and Kassim Alsraiha, a faculty member of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev.\nThe first session focused on the essence of the human being. It began with introductory remarks about Judaism and Islam and about the development of the various movements within each faith. This was followed by hevruta study (study in pairs) of texts from the Torah and the Koran. It was interesting to find that both the Koran and the Talmud include the statement that anyone who saves one life is considered as having saved an entire world and anyone who destroys one life is considered to have destroyed an entire world. When the entire group reconvened, we discussed what we had read and understood from the texts.\nThe second session focused on martyrdom. Dr. Al Atawneh began the meeting with a fascinating lecture that analyzed the concept of jihad \u2013 an emotionally charged topic today \u2013 and discussed its true meaning, as it appears in the Koran and was interpreted by the Islamic sages. He spoke about jihad of the spirit, which requires human effort each day, and jihad of the sword, which includes strict laws of ethics during warfare. Following this, he discussed who may be defined as a \"shahid\" (martyr) in Islam.\nDr. Calderon then facilitated a study session that connected the concept of the shahid in Islam with that the concept of martyrdom in Judaism. We read an excerpt from Tractate Berakhot of the Babylonian Talmud describing the conversation between Rabbi Akiva and his students during his execution. The time for the morning recitation of the Shema had arrived, and Rabbi Akiva insisted on reciting this statement of faith in complete acceptance of his fate, experiencing the sacrifice of his life as an act of absolute love for God.\nAt the end of the session, we discussed the importance Judaism ascribes to martyrdom and the similarity between Jewish martyrdom and the essence of the shahid in Islam.\nThe third session focused on the story of the Binding of Isaac. Although it is a foundational story in both faiths, the Binding of Isaac is a complex story that is at times difficult to accept. During the meeting, we read the account of the Binding of Isaac in the Koran and in the Torah and noted the similarities and differences between the two stories. For example, we learned that in the Jewish story, Abraham goes with Isaac to Mount Moriah in agonized silence, without telling his son what he has been commanded to do. In the Muslim story, however, Abraham tells his son what God commanded in his dream and asks his son for his viewpoint. His son, in turn, asks him to obey the command and, in essence, submits to God's will together with this father.\nIt was also interesting to learn that the name of Abraham's son never appears in the Muslim story. The reason for this seems to be that it makes no difference who the son was; the purpose of this religious story is not to teach us history, but to teach us something about ourselves. When we read the story of the Binding of Isaac, we must think about where it finds us and what we can derive from it for our day-to-day lives.\nThe final session explored the leadership of Moses and Pharaoh, a topic that was particularly relevant, since the session took place just after Passover. First we learned how the hostility to the nation of Israel developed, moving from a situation of Jewish coexistence with the Egyptians to near-genocide of the Jewish people. The turning point began when a pharaoh arose \"who did not know Joseph,\" who saw the growing nation of Israel as a threat. The texts depict Pharaoh as a leader who is motivated by fear and who motivates by intimidation. He divided the Egyptians and caused everyone to suffer. Moses, in contrast, is presented as a leader who possesses humility, justice, and faith. We can learn from the stories of Pharaoh and Moses that leadership based on compulsion is ephemeral and destined to meet its demise in the Red Sea, while leadership based on inner strength and vision leads to liberation and to good.\n","html_content":"<p>\u200b\u200bOver the last three months, we experienced a fascinating journey into our ancient, primary sources, both Muslim and Jewish.
