                                            <p style="text-align:justify;">This was a series of three meetings offering the opportunity to learn about the link between management in general and managing human resources; to examine together issues that arise in the field, and possible solutions; and to gain new knowledge, and learn from the unique experiences of Major-General Orna Barbivai, who as head of the IDF Manpower Directorate oversaw human resources in Israel’s largest organization.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">​Each of the three sessions addressed a major human resource management issue of relevance to graduates and their organizations: the leadership-management challenge presented by the distance between the needs of the system and the needs of the individual; decision-making processes in a changing reality, with an emphasis on human resources; and maximizing the organization’s human advantages&nbsp;- how can quality and excellence be assured?
