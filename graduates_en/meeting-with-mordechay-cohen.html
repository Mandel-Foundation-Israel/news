                                            <p>​On April 18 2017, the Mandel Graduate Unit hosted a meeting with Mordechay Cohen, the director general of the Ministry of the Interior and a graduate of Cohort 8 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, as part of a series called&nbsp;"Encounters with policy-makers and opinion leaders.”&nbsp;At the start of the evening, Professor David Dery, director of the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North, interviewed Mordechay Cohen, who presented his ideas and professional vision regarding the role of local government in the Israeli government system, described the main issues currently facing him as director general of the ministry, and shared thoughts about future directions of activity.</p>
<p>There was then an open discussion with graduates who hold positions in local authorities, which was moderated by Sharona Bar-Nes, a graduate of Cohort 16 who headed the education administration of the Mateh Yehuda regional council until recently. The discussion focused on interactions between central government, local authorities, and municipal education departments. Participants shared their experiences of the challenges that typify these interfaces, as well as other experiences from their professional lives, such as forging partnerships, leading change via regional collaboration, developing long-term plans, and having a vision for the future.</p>
<p>Afterwards, a number of Mandel fellows and graduates presented “Issues from the Field,” focusing on specific topics and initiatives they are seeking to advance for the betterment of Israeli society and education. The evening concluded with small roundtable conversations and dinner, with a theme drawn from the Moroccan Jewish community’s Mimouna celebrations, which follow the Passover holiday and had taken place that the same day.</p>
