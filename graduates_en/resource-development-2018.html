                                            <p>​As leaders of organizations, schools, and educational and social enterprises, Mandel graduates are often required to engage in resource development – including fundraising – for their institutions. Knowledge in this area is important even for those who are not directly responsible for this matter within their places of work.</p>
<p>In order to provide graduates with knowledge and practice in this important field, the Mandel Graduate Unit developed a study day that incorporated both theoretical and practical elements. The program included a review of current trends in resource development, and presented practical tools for strategic planning in this area.</p>
<p>The event was planned by <b>Rakefet Mossek</b>, consultations manager at the Mandel Graduate Unit, and <strong>Ruti Srebro</strong>, a senior consultant and partner at Ariel Kedem Resource Development, which specializes in strategic consulting to non-profit organizations and in resource development.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Uri Ben-Ner</strong>, a strategic and organizational consultant to foundations and Jewish communities around the world, gave a lecture on innovation in resource development, This was followed by an open discussion with representatives of a number of philanthropic foundations active in Israel.<br></p>
