                                            <p>​On September 5, 2018, 
   <strong>Tomer Oshry</strong>, a graduate of Cohort 19 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership and director of the Erez network of pre-military programs, held a meeting for the network’s senior staff in collaboration with the Mandel Graduate Unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The meeting was designed to serve as a launch event at which Oshry could present his conceptual approach, introduce new discourse and messages, and begin the process of creating an organizational vision for the Erez network of pre-military academies.</p>
<p>During the session, the network's staff members became better acquainted with one another, discussed the process of creating a vision and shared work mechanisms, thought together about interfaces and partnerships, and spoke about instituting regular learning and sharing sessions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process used at the meeting was based on the Mandel leadership approach, with a focus on developing personal vision into an organizational vision, and on the dialogue between the two.<br></p>
