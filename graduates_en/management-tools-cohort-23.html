                                            <p>​As part of the Mandel Graduate Unit’s continuation programs, a workshop on “Measurement as a Management Tool” was held on May 11 2013, for graduates of Cohort 23 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership. Facilitated by the staff of the Graduate Unit, the session introduced participants to measurement and planning tools used in aviation, employment, and education.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen increasing professionalization of management in educational-social organizations. Tools have been developed to help the leadership of these bodies manage resources more efficiently and make real-time decisions, particularly in situations marked by uncertainty and changing resources. At this session, participants learned how to create an organizational dashboard, define measurement parameters, and plan measurement processes that can provide results in real time.</p>
<p>The workshop introduced participants to measurement parameters used in the fields of aviation, employment, and education. Mr. Kobi Mor, formerly the director general of the Israel Airports Authority, spoke about his professional experience with measurement in aviation. Dr. Arie Haskin, director of the Jerusalem Employment Bureau and a graduate of Cohort 15 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, presented information about measurements used in employment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the workshop, Dr. Granit Almog-Bareket, director of the Mandel Graduate Unit and a graduate of Cohort 14 of the Mandel School, taught about measurements used in education and, together with the participants, examined alternative tools for evaluation and measurement in educational organizations.<br></p>
