                                            <p style="text-align:justify;">​​A seminar comprising a series of sessions, giving participating graduates the opportunity to air questions about leadership and to examine its role a​nd meaning in their lives. Techniques are learned; leadership is nurtured. Alongside a theoretical review of the state of knowledge in this field, the seminar will analyze case studies&nbsp;that provide insight into the unique nature of leadership, what it demands of us, and its inherent promise to realize ideas and dreams even when there is no reason to believe they can succeed.</p>
<p>​The aim of the seminar is to provide graduates with the tools to develop their own organization's human resources by implementing leadership development programs.
