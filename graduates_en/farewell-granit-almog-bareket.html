                                            <p>​<strong>Dr. Granit Almog-Bareke</strong>t, a graduate of Cohort 14 of the Mandel School for Educational Leadership, joined the leadership of the Mandel Graduate Unit upon completion of her studies at the Mandel School and was a member of the Unit’s founding team, which developed its unique model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The underlying principle of the Mandel Graduate Unit's work is that a leader's growth and development is a continuing process, and that real leadership depends not only on developing new capabilities, but also on maintaining and deepening existing skills and remaining in constant and critical dialogue with reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granit worked tirelessly to create unique programs tailored to the diverse and changing professional needs of Mandel graduates, while focusing on professional identity and on formulating and developing the vision of the graduates. Her research articles, which present unique perspectives on dimensions of leadership and management, have been published in academic journals and presented at major conferences.</p>
<p>Following Granit's decision to pursue new professional goals, a farewell event was held in her honor. The event was attended by dozens of graduates, the senior management and employees of the Mandel Foundation–Israel, members of Granit’s family, and her colleagues.<br><br></p>
